# Executive Function Frameworks: Research Synthesis

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Purpose:** Synthesize academic and business frameworks on executive functions to inform executive function model development

---

## Executive Summary

This research synthesizes established frameworks for understanding executive work across four key dimensions:

1. **Core Executive Functions** - What executives do (roles, responsibilities, activities)
2. **Domain/Context Models** - How executives organize awareness across areas
3. **Temporal Dimensions** - How executives work across time horizons
4. **Information & Decision Cycles** - How executives gather, process, decide, and act

The research identifies three foundational frameworks with strong empirical backing:

- **Mintzberg's Managerial Roles** (1973) - Comprehensive taxonomy of what executives do
- **McKinsey's Three Horizons** (1999) - Temporal framework for balancing present and future
- **OODA Loop** (Boyd, 1990s) - Information processing and decision cycle

---

## 1. Core Executive Functions: What Executives Do

### 1.1 Mintzberg's Managerial Roles Framework (1973)

Henry Mintzberg's empirical research observing CEOs across five organizations identified **10 managerial roles** grouped into three categories:

#### **Interpersonal Roles** (Interface with People)
1. **Figurehead** - Symbolic duties, ceremonial obligations
2. **Leader** - Motivating, developing, and directing people
3. **Liaison** - Maintaining networks outside the organization

#### **Informational Roles** (Managing Information Flow)
4. **Monitor** - Collecting information from inside and outside
5. **Disseminator** - Sharing information with subordinates
6. **Spokesperson** - Representing the organization externally

#### **Decisional Roles** (Making Choices and Taking Action)
7. **Entrepreneur** - Initiating change and improvement projects
8. **Disturbance Handler** - Responding to crises and pressures
9. **Resource Allocator** - Deciding how to deploy resources
10. **Negotiator** - Resolving conflicts and making deals

**Key Insight:** Executives fulfill all 10 roles in varying proportions depending on level and context. The framework provides a practical checklist of what effective managers actually do: connect with people, share and interpret information, and make sound decisions.

### 1.2 Drucker's Management Functions

Peter Drucker, "the father of modern management," emphasized that businesses have only **two essential functions**:

1. **Innovation** - Creating new value
2. **Marketing** - Creating customers

His broader framework emphasizes:
- **Management by Objectives (MBO)** - Setting clear, measurable goals
- **Decentralization** - Pushing decision authority closer to work
- **Knowledge Work** - Empowering knowledge workers (term he coined)
- **Effectiveness** - The fundamental requirement of executive action

**Key Insight:** Drucker viewed management as focused on people, results, and continuous adaptation rather than mere control. He emphasized that effectiveness requires focusing on contribution (results) rather than effort.

### 1.3 Porter's Competitive Strategy

Michael Porter's work focuses on strategic positioning and competitive analysis, with executives responsible for:

1. **Industry Analysis** - Understanding competitive forces
2. **Strategic Positioning** - Choosing where and how to compete
3. **Value Chain Analysis** - Optimizing activities for advantage
4. **Competitive Response** - Anticipating and countering rivals

Porter's **Five Forces Framework** (1979) defines the competitive dimensions executives must monitor:
- Threat of new entrants
- Bargaining power of suppliers
- Bargaining power of buyers
- Threat of substitutes
- Rivalry among existing competitors

## 2. Domain/Context Models: Organizing Executive Awareness

### 2.1 Environmental Scanning Framework

Environmental scanning involves systematically gathering and analyzing information about external and internal forces to identify threats, opportunities, and strategic implications.

**PESTEL Analysis** - Six macro-environmental domains:
1. **Political** - Government policies, regulations, stability
2. **Economic** - Economic cycles, exchange rates, growth
3. **Social** - Demographics, culture, lifestyle trends
4. **Technological** - Innovation, automation, digital transformation
5. **Environmental** - Sustainability, climate, resource availability
6. **Legal** - Laws, compliance, litigation

**Key Insight:** Chief Executive Officers are often the key person in environmental scanning because they centralize all information. Closer collaboration between IT and business executives allows organizations to better sense threats and opportunities.

- [What Is an Environmental Scan?](https://www.business.com/articles/what-is-environmental-scanning/)

### 2.2 Stakeholder Theory (Freeman, 1984)

R. Edward Freeman's Stakeholder Theory argues that executives must balance the interests of **multiple stakeholder groups** rather than focusing solely on shareholders:

**Key Stakeholder Domains:**
1. **Shareholders/Investors** - Financial returns, governance
2. **Customers** - Value delivery, satisfaction
3. **Employees** - Development, engagement, wellbeing
4. **Suppliers/Partners** - Mutually beneficial relationships
5. **Communities** - Social impact, local presence
6. **Regulators** - Compliance, responsible practices

**Executive Task:** Create as much value as possible for stakeholders without resorting to tradeoffs. "Managing for stakeholders" involves attending to the interests and wellbeing of these groups.

### 2.3 Business Architecture Domains

Enterprise and business architecture frameworks define standard domain categories:

**TOGAF Four Domains:**
1. **Business Architecture** - Processes, capabilities, organization
2. **Data Architecture** - Information assets and flows
3. **Application Architecture** - Systems and interfaces
4. **Technology Architecture** - Infrastructure and platforms

**BIZBOK (Business Architecture Body of Knowledge) Four Domains:**
1. **Value Streams** - How value flows to customers
2. **Capabilities** - What the organization can do
3. **Organization** - Structure and roles
4. **Information** - Data and knowledge assets

**Zachman Framework Perspectives:**
- Executive (Scope/Context)
- Business Management (Business Concepts)
- Architect (System Logic)
- Engineer (Technology Physics)
- Technician (Component Assemblies)
- Enterprise (Operations)

## 3. Temporal Dimensions: Working Across Time Horizons

### 3.1 McKinsey's Three Horizons Framework (1999)

Introduced in "The Alchemy of Growth" by Baghai, Coley, and White, this framework addresses how executives manage current performance while maximizing future opportunities.

**The Three Horizons:**

**Horizon 1 - Core Business (Present, 0-2 years)**
- Current operations generating most profit and cash flow
- Focus: Optimize and defend existing business
- Timeframe: Immediate to short-term
- Goals: Efficiency, market share, profitability

**Horizon 2 - Emerging Opportunities (Near Future, 2-5 years)**
- Rising ventures requiring investment today for future profit
- Focus: Scale new businesses and capabilities
- Timeframe: Medium-term
- Goals: Growth engines, market expansion

**Horizon 3 - Future Innovation (Far Future, 5+ years)**
- Small ventures, pilots, R&D, exploratory investments
- Focus: Options for future transformation
- Timeframe: Long-term
- Goals: Strategic positioning, transformation readiness

**Key Principle:** Companies must manage businesses along all three horizons concurrently. The framework bridges the gap between innovation and current operations.

- [McKinsey's Three Horizons of Growth Model Explained](https://strategicmanagementinsight.com/tools/three-horizons-growth-model/)

### 3.2 Pace Layers (Stewart Brand, 1999)

From "The Clock of the Long Now," Brand's framework shows how systems operate at different speeds:

**The Six Pace Layers (Fast to Slow):**
1. **Fashion** - Days to months (trends, fads)
2. **Commerce** - Months to years (markets, competition)
3. **Infrastructure** - Years to decades (systems, buildings)
4. **Governance** - Decades (policies, regulations)
5. **Culture** - Generations (values, norms)
6. **Nature** - Millennia (environment, biology)

**Key Principle:** "Fast learns, slow remembers. Fast proposes, slow disposes. Fast is discontinuous, slow is continuous. Fast and small instructs slow and big by accrued innovation and by occasional revolution. Slow and big controls small and fast by constraint and constancy."

**Organizational Application:**
Inside companies, activities exist in similar layers:
- **Daily work** - Tactical execution
- **Weekly meetings** - Coordination and adjustment
- **Sprints/Quarters** - Project delivery cycles
- **Annual planning** - Strategic goals and budgets
- **Multi-year strategy** - Vision and transformation
- **Brand/Culture** - Identity and values (decade+)

**Gartner Enterprise Software Adaptation:**
- **Systems of Innovation** - Up to 6 months
- **Systems of Differentiation** - 1-3 years
- **Systems of Record** - 7+ years

- [Paul Saffo & Stewart Brand: Pace Layers Thinking](https://longnow.org/seminars/02015/jan/27/pace-layers-thinking/)
- [Layers of Time: Pace Layers of Work](https://www.sunsama.com/blog/layers-of-time-pace-layers-of-work)

### 3.3 Strategic Planning Time Horizons

Research on strategic planning identifies common timeframe definitions:

- **Short-term:** 0-1 year (quarterly, monthly goals)
- **Mid-term:** 1-5 years (bridging goals to strategy)
- **Long-term:** 5-20 years (vision, transformation)

**Key Finding:** The "strategic term" varies by company and strategy. The time horizon should match the time required to implement strategic changes, not arbitrary periods. Organizations prioritizing long-term value creation are more effective at translating strategy into actionable plans.

## 4. Information & Decision Cycles: How Executives Process and Act

### 4.1 OODA Loop (John Boyd, 1990s)

Developed by Air Force Colonel John Boyd from studying combat tactics, the OODA Loop describes rapid decision-making in competitive environments.

**The Four Stages:**

1. **Observe** - Gather information through all available senses and sources
   - Environmental signals
   - Competitor actions
   - Internal metrics
   - Stakeholder feedback

2. **Orient** - Contextualize observations using existing knowledge
   - Cultural traditions
   - Genetic heritage
   - Previous experiences
   - Analysis and synthesis
   - This is the most important step - orientation shapes interpretation

3. **Decide** - Choose a course of action based on observation and orientation
   - Evaluate options
   - Select response
   - Consider consequences

4. **Act** - Execute the decision
   - Implement chosen action
   - Monitor results
   - Feed outcomes back to Observe

**Key Principle:** It's called a "loop" because decision-making is continuous - your actions change the situation, requiring new observations. The goal is to cycle through OODA faster than competitors, enabling you to act inside their decision cycle.

**Executive Application:** Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, explicitly uses the OODA loop in scenario evaluation, describing it as "a strategic process of constant review, analysis, decision making and action" in conditions of uncertainty. Successful CEOs use OODA (often implicitly) to survive and thrive in competitive environments.

- [OODA loop - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop)

### 4.2 Sensemaking (Karl Weick, 1995)

Karl Weick's sensemaking theory shifts focus from rational decision-making to how meaning is constructed in organizations.

**Definition:** "The ongoing retrospective development of plausible images that rationalize what people are doing."

**Seven Properties of Sensemaking:**
1. **Identity and Identification** - Who people think they are shapes interpretation
2. **Retrospective** - Meaning is made by looking back at events
3. **Enactive** - People create the environments they face through action
4. **Social** - Sensemaking happens through conversation and interaction
5. **Ongoing** - Never starts or stops, always in the middle
6. **Focused on Extracted Cues** - Simple signals trigger elaborate interpretations
7. **Driven by Plausibility** - Seeks what's reasonable, not necessarily accurate

**Shift from Decision-Making:** Traditional models emphasize strategic rationality and optimization. Weick argues this ignores the inherent complexity and ambiguity of real organizations. Sensemaking focuses on how meaning drives organizing, not just how decisions shape organizations.

**Executive Implication:** Leaders must recognize they're not just making decisions in a known environment - they're actively constructing meaning and shaping the reality in which decisions occur. The process is social, ongoing, and identity-dependent.

### 4.3 Decision Velocity Framework

Decision velocity measures how quickly and effectively decisions are made and executed, with high velocity accelerating innovation and competitive advantage.

**Key Framework Components:**

1. **Agency by Default** - Empower team members to make decisions independently without permission or approval

2. **Bias for Action** - Prefer rapid iteration over perfect alignment and consensus

3. **Trust and Values** - Clear values and high trust enable faster decisions
   - High-trust cultures: ~3 days for decisions
   - Low-trust cultures: ~4 weeks for same decisions
   - **9.3x faster in high-trust environments**

4. **Small Frequent Decisions** - Break big decisions into smaller ones
   - Reduces risk of catastrophic failure
   - Provides faster feedback
   - Builds decision-making capability

**Agile Strategy Execution:** Apply iterative approaches beyond software - break tasks into small pieces, deliver value early and continuously, adjust based on feedback.

## 5. Synthesis and Recommendations

### 5.1 Recommended Core Executive Functions (7 Functions)

Synthesizing Mintzberg, Drucker, Porter, and modern frameworks, I recommend **7 core executive functions** organized into three clusters:

#### **A. Sense & Understand (Informational)**
1. **Monitor & Scan** - Gather information from all relevant sources (combines Mintzberg's Monitor with environmental scanning)
2. **Analyze & Orient** - Make sense of information, identify patterns, contextualize (combines OODA Orient with Weick's sensemaking)

#### **B. Decide & Direct (Decisional)**
3. **Set Strategy & Direction** - Define vision, priorities, positioning (synthesizes Drucker effectiveness and Porter strategy)
4. **Allocate Resources** - Deploy capital, talent, time, attention (Mintzberg's Resource Allocator + attention management)
5. **Execute & Adjust** - Take action, monitor results, adapt rapidly (OODA Act + decision velocity)

#### **C. Connect & Enable (Interpersonal)**
6. **Build Relationships** - Develop networks, negotiate, represent organization (combines Mintzberg's Liaison, Negotiator, Spokesperson)
7. **Lead & Develop** - Inspire people, build capability, drive change (combines Mintzberg's Leader and Entrepreneur)

**Rationale:** This framework reduces Mintzberg's 10 roles to 7 more strategic functions while incorporating insights from information processing (OODA, sensemaking) and modern leadership requirements (agility, decision velocity). It maintains the three-cluster structure (Sense/Decide/Connect) which aligns with how executives actually think about their work.

### 5.2 Recommended Domain Categories (5 Types)

Drawing from PESTEL, Stakeholder Theory, and Business Architecture frameworks:

1. **Market & Competition** - Customers, competitors, industry dynamics (Porter's Five Forces)
2. **Operations & Capabilities** - Internal processes, resources, capabilities (Business Architecture)
3. **People & Organization** - Talent, culture, structure (Stakeholder + HR)
4. **Technology & Innovation** - Digital transformation, R&D, intellectual property (PESTEL Technology)
5. **External Environment** - Macro forces: political, economic, social, regulatory (PESTEL)

**Rationale:** These five domains cover the critical areas executives must monitor without excessive granularity. They map cleanly to established frameworks while remaining actionable.

### 5.3 Recommended Temporal Dimension Approach

Adopt a **hybrid Three Horizons + Pace Layers** model:

**Time Horizons (McKinsey):**
- **H1 - Present/Core** (0-2 years) - Current business optimization
- **H2 - Emerging** (2-5 years) - Growth engines and new capabilities
- **H3 - Future/Options** (5+ years) - Transformational possibilities

**Pace Layers (Brand):**
- **Fast** (days to quarters) - Tactical decisions, operations, experiments
- **Medium** (quarters to years) - Strategic initiatives, organizational change
- **Slow** (years to decades) - Culture, brand, governance, deep capabilities

**Integration:** Executives must simultaneously:
- Operate across all three horizons (portfolio management)
- Respect the different pace of decisions at each layer
- Match decision velocity to the appropriate horizon/layer

**Key Insight:** Use Three Horizons for strategic portfolio management (what to work on) and Pace Layers for execution tempo (how fast to move). Not all work in H3 is slow - you might run fast experiments on H3 ideas. Not all H1 work is fast - core systems might change slowly even as markets shift quickly.

### 5.4 How These Dimensions Interact

**The Integrated Executive Function Model:**

```

**Key Interactions:**

1. **Functions × Domains:** Each executive function operates across all five domains
   - Example: "Monitor & Scan" applies to Market (competitive intel), Operations (metrics), People (engagement), Technology (trends), External (regulatory)

2. **Functions × Time:** Executive functions emphasize different horizons
   - H1: Heavy on Execute & Adjust, Monitor & Scan (operations focus)
   - H2: Heavy on Set Strategy, Allocate Resources (growth focus)
   - H3: Heavy on Analyze & Orient, Lead & Develop (innovation focus)

3. **Time × Domains:** Different domains operate at different paces
   - Fast: Market conditions, operational metrics, competitive moves
   - Medium: Organizational capabilities, technology platforms
   - Slow: Culture, brand reputation, regulatory environment

4. **The Information Flow:** OODA Loop connects all dimensions
   - **Observe** (Monitor & Scan) across Domains and Horizons
   - **Orient** (Analyze & Orient) to make sense in context
   - **Decide** (Set Strategy, Allocate Resources) for appropriate horizon
   - **Act** (Execute & Adjust) with velocity matched to pace layer
   - Results feed back to Observe (continuous loop)

5. **Decision Velocity Varies:**
   - Tactical/H1/Fast: High velocity (days to weeks)
   - Strategic/H2/Medium: Moderate velocity (weeks to quarters)
   - Transformational/H3/Slow: Deliberate velocity (quarters to years)

## 7. Conclusion

The research reveals strong convergence across frameworks:

1. **Executive work is multidimensional** - Executives must simultaneously fulfill interpersonal, informational, and decisional roles (Mintzberg)

2. **Multiple time horizons are essential** - Success requires managing present performance while building future options (Three Horizons, Pace Layers)

3. **Information processing is central** - The cycle of observing, orienting, deciding, and acting underlies all executive work (OODA, Sensemaking)

4. **Context matters** - Executives must scan across multiple domains (environmental scanning, stakeholder theory, business architecture)

5. **Speed is relative** - Decision velocity should match the pace layer and time horizon, not maximize for its own sake

The recommended framework synthesizes these insights into an actionable model with:
- **7 executive functions** organized into Sense/Decide/Connect clusters
- **5 domain categories** covering the critical environmental areas
- **Hybrid temporal approach** using Three Horizons for portfolio and Pace Layers for rhythm
- **OODA Loop** as the integrating information cycle connecting all dimensions

This framework provides a research-grounded foundation for building executive function models, tools, or organizational designs.

**Document Status:** Research synthesis complete
**Next Steps:**
1. Validate framework with executive practitioners
2. Develop operational definitions for each function
3. Create assessment tools to evaluate executive function maturity
4. Design interventions to strengthen specific functions
