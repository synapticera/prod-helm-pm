# Helm Positioning Summary: Executive Agent for Service Leaders

## The Core Positioning

### One-Line Pitch

> "Helm is the Executive Agent that gives service leaders autonomous command of their AI-powered operations."

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Enterprise AI agents are proliferating, but service leaders have no way to understand, design, or govern how they make decisions. Helm is the Executive Agent—an AI that sits above your agents, captures their decision patterns, helps you redesign workflows, and enforces governance. We're building the executive function layer for customer service."

### Category Definition

**Decision Intelligence for Customer Service** — the infrastructure that enables service leaders to understand, design, and govern AI agent decisions at scale.

## Why Helm, Why Now

### The Market Moment (2026)

| Catalyst            | Data Point                                     | Source        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Agent explosion     | 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents     | Gartner       |
| ROI gap             | 88% deployed AI, only 39% seeing EBIT impact   | McKinsey      |
| Governance vacuum   | "You cannot trust agents to police themselves" | Forrester     |
| Regulatory deadline | EU AI Act enforcement August 2026              | EU Commission |

### The Problem We Solve

**For Service Leaders:**

- AI agents are making decisions they can't see or understand
- No systematic way to improve agent performance
- Compliance risk with no audit trails
- ROI claims they can't validate

**The Root Cause:**

> Companies have execution (agents) but lack executive function (understanding, planning, governance)

**Analogy:** Like having a flight recorder for your customer service AI

### Design: Plan How It Should Work

**Capability:** Use decision data to redesign workflows
**Value:** "Design your operations around what actually works, not what you hope works"
**Analogy:** Like having an architect for your AI-powered processes

### Manage: Govern and Improve

**Capability:** Enforce policies, monitor outcomes, continuous improvement
**Value:** "Ensure agents behave as intended and get better over time"
**Analogy:** Like having a control tower for your AI fleet

> Stage 2→3 transition (where financial returns materialize) requires "organizational alignment, governance structures, and outcome measurement."

**Bain:**

> "Real-time explainability, behavioral observability, and adaptive security are essential to mitigate risk."

## Target Buyer Profile

### Primary Buyer: VP of Customer Service / CCO

**Title Variants:**

**Decision Criteria:**

- Can I see what my agents are doing?
- Will this help me prove value to the CFO?
- Does this reduce my compliance risk?
- Can my team actually use this?

## Competitive Positioning

### What Helm is NOT

| We're Not             | Why Not                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| An AI agent vendor    | We govern agents, not replace them              |
| An analytics platform | We enable action, not just reporting            |
| A chatbot             | We're infrastructure for leaders, not customers |
| An IT tool            | We serve business leaders, not technologists    |
