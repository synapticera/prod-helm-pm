### MIT NANDA: The GenAI Divide - State of AI in Business 2025

**Publication:** July 2025
**Authors:** Aditya Challapally, Chris Pease, Ramesh Raskar, Pradyumna Chari (MIT Media Lab, Project NANDA)
**Sample Size:** 300+ AI initiatives reviewed, 52 structured interviews, 153 survey responses
**Focus:** Enterprise GenAI pilot success rates and failure patterns

**Key Findings:**

| Metric                                | Finding                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GenAI pilots with no P&L impact       | 95% fail to show measurable business results |
| Enterprise AI spending                | $30-40 billion invested                      |
| External vendor success rate          | 67% (2x better than internal builds)         |
| Internal build success rate           | 33%                                          |
| Custom tools reaching production      | Only 5%                                      |
| Industries with structural disruption | Only 2 of 9 (Tech, Media)                    |

**The "GenAI Divide" Explained:**

> "The core barrier is learning rather than infrastructure, regulation, or talent. Most GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time."

**Four Structural Factors:**

1. **Limited disruption** - Only Tech and Media show material business transformation
2. **Enterprise paradox** - Large firms lead in pilot volume but lag in successful deployment
3. **Investment bias** - AI budgets favor sales/marketing despite better ROI in operations/finance
4. **Implementation advantage** - External vendor tools succeed 2x more often than internal builds

**Shadow AI Economy:**

- 40% of companies have official LLM subscriptions
- 90% of workers use personal AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) for job tasks daily
- Shadow systems often outperform corporate tools

**Helm Relevance:** Validates need for specialized vendor partnerships over DIY; supports workflow adaptation as key differentiator; confirms internal builds have poor success rates
