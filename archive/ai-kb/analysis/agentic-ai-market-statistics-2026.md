## Part 9: Key Quotes

### Rick Villars, Group Vice President, Worldwide Research at IDC

> "An important takeaway from this forecast is the clear alignment between the growth in (AI) spending and IT leaders' trust that effective use of AI can boost future business success. Application and Services providers that are behind in putting AI into their products and not extending them with agents are risking market share losses to companies that made the decision to put AI at the center of their product development roadmap."
