# Executive Operating System: Healthcare Payers

**Industry:** Health Insurance Companies, Managed Care Organizations, Medicare/Medicaid Plans
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Purpose:** Industry-specific application of the Executive OS framework (4 Functions × 5 Domains) for healthcare payer organizations

---

## Executive Summary

Healthcare payer executives face unique challenges in managing complex, highly regulated organizations that must balance clinical quality, member satisfaction, provider relationships, regulatory compliance, and financial sustainability. This document maps the Executive Operating System framework to the healthcare payer context, showing how the 4×5 matrix applies to real executive responsibilities.

**Key Context Differences:**
- "Customers" = Members (beneficiaries) + Providers + Employers (group sponsors)
- Heavy regulatory oversight (CMS, state departments of insurance)
- Quality is externally measured (CMS Star Ratings, HEDIS, CAHPS)
- Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) is regulated by law (80-85% of premiums)
- Network adequacy and access are compliance requirements

## Strategic Outcomes: Healthcare Payer Executive Scorecard

The 4×5 matrix drives toward these strategic outcomes that payer executives are measured against:

### 1. Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) - Target: 80-85%
**Formula:** (Medical Claims + Quality Improvement) / Premium Revenue
**Why it matters:** Regulated by ACA; if too high, not profitable; if too low, must issue rebates
**Typical target:** 82-84% (sweet spot between profitability and regulatory compliance)

### 2. Member Growth and Retention
**Metrics:** Net enrollment growth, member retention rate (>90% good), member months
**Why it matters:** Volume drives revenue and scale; retention is cheaper than acquisition
**Typical target:** 5-10% annual member growth, >90% retention

### 3. CMS Star Rating (Medicare Advantage)
**Scale:** 1-5 stars (half-star increments)
**Why it matters:** 4+ stars qualify for quality bonus payments (~5% premium increase), marketing advantages
**Typical target:** 4.0+ stars (top performers aim for 4.5-5.0)

### 4. HEDIS Quality Performance
**Measures:** 90+ measures across 6 domains, benchmarked nationally
**Why it matters:** Drives Star Ratings, employer purchasing decisions, state contracts
**Typical target:** 75th percentile or higher on priority measures

### 5. Net Promoter Score (NPS) - Member Satisfaction
**Scale:** -100 to +100 (% promoters - % detractors)
**Why it matters:** Predicts member retention, word-of-mouth, competitive advantage
**Typical target:** NPS >50 (excellent), >30 (good)

### 6. Operating Margin
**Formula:** (Revenue - Medical Costs - Administrative Costs) / Revenue
**Why it matters:** Shareholder returns, capital adequacy, reinvestment capacity
**Typical target:** 2-4% for commercial, 3-5% for Medicare Advantage

### 7. Days in Claims Payable (DCP)
**Formula:** Claims Payable / (Annual Claims Expense / 365)
**Why it matters:** Working capital efficiency, provider satisfaction, regulatory compliance
**Typical target:** <45 days (fast payers), 45-60 days (industry average)
