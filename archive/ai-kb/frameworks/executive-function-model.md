# Executive Function Model Framework

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Purpose:** Comprehensive framework for understanding what executives do, how they organize awareness, and how they operate across time

---

## Executive Summary

This framework defines a complete model of executive work across three interconnected dimensions:

1. **Functions** - What executives do (7 core capabilities)
2. **Domains** - What executives pay attention to (5 context areas)
3. **Time** - When executives operate (3 horizons × 3 pace layers)

The model is research-based, synthesizing work from Mintzberg (managerial roles), McKinsey (Three Horizons), Boyd (OODA Loop), Brand (Pace Layers), and modern decision velocity research.

**Key Insight:** Executive effectiveness requires simultaneously executing all functions, across all domains, at multiple time horizons—with decision velocity matched to the appropriate pace layer.

---

## Dimension 1: Core Executive Functions (WHAT)

Executives perform **7 core functions** organized into three clusters that mirror the information processing cycle:

### A. Sense & Understand (Informational)

#### 1. Monitor & Scan
**Gather information from all relevant sources**

- Environmental scanning (market signals, competitive moves)
- Internal metrics and performance data
- Stakeholder feedback and sentiment
- Weak signals and emerging patterns
- Direct observation and frontline engagement

*Research basis:* Mintzberg's Monitor role + environmental scanning literature

#### 2. Analyze & Orient
**Make sense of information, identify patterns, contextualize meaning**

- Pattern recognition across disparate signals
- Causal analysis (what's driving what?)
- Contextual interpretation (what does this mean for us?)
- Mental model refinement (updating beliefs)
- Sensemaking through discussion and dialogue

*Research basis:* OODA Loop's Orient step + Weick's Sensemaking theory

---

### B. Decide & Direct (Decisional)

#### 3. Set Strategy & Direction
**Define vision, priorities, and competitive positioning**

- Strategic positioning (where to play, how to win)
- Vision articulation (compelling future state)
- Priority setting (focus and sequencing)
- Goal definition (clear outcomes)
- Strategic trade-offs (what to stop doing)

*Research basis:* Drucker's effectiveness + Porter's competitive strategy

#### 4. Allocate Resources
**Deploy capital, talent, time, and attention**

- Budget and investment decisions
- Talent deployment and hiring
- Time allocation (executive attention is scarce)
- Political capital expenditure
- Portfolio management across horizons

*Research basis:* Mintzberg's Resource Allocator role + attention management

#### 5. Execute & Adjust
**Take action, monitor results, adapt rapidly**

- Decisive action (bias for action)
- Rapid iteration and experimentation
- Performance monitoring (results tracking)
- Course correction (adaptive response)
- Learning integration (what worked, what didn't)

*Research basis:* OODA Loop's Act step + decision velocity frameworks

---

### C. Connect & Enable (Interpersonal)

#### 6. Build Relationships
**Develop networks, negotiate, represent the organization**

- Network cultivation (internal and external)
- Stakeholder relationship management
- Negotiation and conflict resolution
- Organizational representation (spokesperson)
- Coalition building and influence

*Research basis:* Mintzberg's Liaison, Negotiator, Spokesperson roles

#### 7. Lead & Develop
**Inspire people, build capability, drive change**

- People development (coaching, mentoring)
- Culture shaping (norms, values, behaviors)
- Change leadership (transformation initiatives)
- Team building (cohesion and capability)
- Entrepreneurial initiative (innovation sponsorship)

*Research basis:* Mintzberg's Leader + Entrepreneur roles + modern leadership research

---

## Dimension 2: Domain Categories (WHERE)

Executives apply their functions across **5 critical domains**:

### 1. Market & Competition
**Customers, competitors, industry dynamics**

- Customer needs, preferences, satisfaction
- Competitive positioning and moves
- Market trends and shifts
- Industry structure and evolution
- Substitutes and disruptors

*Maps to:* Porter's Five Forces, competitive intelligence

### 2. Operations & Capabilities
**Internal processes, resources, capabilities**

- Core business processes and workflows
- Operational efficiency and quality
- Supply chain and logistics
- Capacity and utilization
- Capabilities and competencies

*Maps to:* Business architecture, value chain analysis

### 3. People & Organization
**Talent, culture, structure**

- Team performance and engagement
- Organizational design and structure
- Culture and values alignment
- Leadership pipeline and succession
- Diversity, equity, inclusion

*Maps to:* Stakeholder theory (employees), organizational development

### 4. Technology & Innovation
**Digital transformation, R&D, intellectual property**

- Technology trends and disruption
- Digital capabilities and platforms
- R&D and innovation pipeline
- Intellectual property portfolio
- Data and AI capabilities

*Maps to:* PESTEL Technology dimension, innovation management

### 5. External Environment
**Macro forces: political, economic, social, regulatory**

- Regulatory and compliance landscape
- Economic conditions and trends
- Political dynamics and risks
- Social movements and expectations
- Environmental and sustainability factors

*Maps to:* PESTEL framework (Political, Economic, Social, Environmental, Legal)

---

## Dimension 3: Temporal Layers (WHEN)

Executives operate across **multiple time horizons** with **different pace layers**:

### Three Horizons Framework (McKinsey)

#### Horizon 1: Present/Core (0-2 years)
**Current business optimization**

- Focus: Defend and extend core business
- Activities: Operational excellence, market share growth
- Financial: Most profit and cash flow today
- Risk: Low (proven business model)

#### Horizon 2: Emerging (2-5 years)
**Growth engines and new capabilities**

- Focus: Scale new businesses and markets
- Activities: New product launches, market expansion
- Financial: Investing today for future profit
- Risk: Medium (validation in progress)

#### Horizon 3: Future/Options (5+ years)
**Transformational possibilities**

- Focus: Options for future transformation
- Activities: R&D, pilots, exploratory ventures
- Financial: Small investments, optionality
- Risk: High (unproven, exploratory)

**Portfolio Principle:** Executives must allocate across all three horizons simultaneously. Typical mix: 70% H1, 20% H2, 10% H3 (varies by context).

---

### Pace Layers (Stewart Brand)

Different activities move at different speeds:

#### Fast Pace (Days to Quarters)
**Tactical decisions, operations, experiments**

- Examples: Daily standups, sprint planning, quick experiments
- Decision velocity: Hours to days
- Feedback cycle: Immediate to weekly
- Characteristics: High frequency, low cost to reverse

#### Medium Pace (Quarters to Years)
**Strategic initiatives, organizational change**

- Examples: Product launches, org redesign, capability building
- Decision velocity: Weeks to months
- Feedback cycle: Monthly to quarterly
- Characteristics: Significant investment, moderate reversibility

#### Slow Pace (Years to Decades)
**Culture, brand, governance, deep capabilities**

- Examples: Cultural transformation, brand repositioning, values
- Decision velocity: Months to years
- Feedback cycle: Annual to multi-year
- Characteristics: Deep investment, hard to reverse

**Integration Principle:** Use Three Horizons for portfolio management (what to work on) and Pace Layers for execution tempo (how fast to move). Match decision velocity to the appropriate pace layer.

## The Integrated Model: How Dimensions Interact

### The Executive Function Matrix

Each **function** applies to each **domain** at each **time horizon/pace**:

```
                    DOMAINS
         Market | Operations | People | Tech | External
         -------+------------+--------+------+---------
SENSE    Monitor & Scan across all domains
         Analyze & Orient to make meaning
         -------+------------+--------+------+---------
DECIDE   Set Strategy & Direction
         Allocate Resources
         Execute & Adjust
         -------+------------+--------+------+---------
CONNECT  Build Relationships
         Lead & Develop

         Applied at: H1/Fast, H2/Medium, H3/Slow
```

### The Information Processing Cycle (OODA Loop)

The OODA Loop connects all dimensions in a continuous cycle:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    OBSERVE                               │
│  Monitor & Scan across Domains (Market, Ops, People...) │
│  At multiple time horizons (H1, H2, H3)                 │
└────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ORIENT                                │
│  Analyze & Orient - Make sense in context               │
│  Update mental models, recognize patterns               │
│  Consider: past experience, culture, genetics           │
└────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼

│  Set Strategy & Direction                               │
│  Allocate Resources across horizons                     │
│  Match decision velocity to pace layer                  │
└────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ACT                                   │
│  Execute & Adjust with appropriate velocity             │
│  Build Relationships, Lead & Develop                    │
│  Monitor results ──────────────┐                        │
└────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┘
                                  │
                                  └──► Feed back to OBSERVE
```

**Key Principle:** The loop runs continuously. Your actions change the situation, requiring new observations. The goal is appropriate velocity—cycle fast enough to remain competitive, but respect the natural pace of different layers.

## Usage Guide

### For Product Strategy (HELM)
1. Use this framework to identify which executive functions HELM serves
2. Map existing features to specific Function × Domain × Time cells
3. Identify gaps where executives struggle (opportunity areas)
4. Validate with executive users through function-specific interviews

### For Executive Self-Assessment
1. Rate yourself on each of the 7 functions (1-5 scale)
2. Identify which domains consume most attention vs should consume
3. Assess time allocation across H1/H2/H3 (are you too present-focused?)
4. Evaluate decision velocity (too slow? too fast for the pace layer?)

### For Organizational Design
1. Map executive roles to primary functions (accountability clarity)
2. Ensure all 7 functions are covered across leadership team
3. Design rituals/cadences matching pace layers (daily/weekly/quarterly/annual)
4. Build systems that support appropriate decision velocity per layer

---

## Next Steps for Framework Development

1. **Validate with executives** - Interview 5-10 executives across functions to validate model
2. **Create assessment tools** - Build diagnostic to evaluate executive function maturity
3. **Develop detailed playbooks** - For each function, create "how to do this well" guides
4. **Map organizational design patterns** - Common ways teams structure around these functions
5. **Build HELM feature mapping** - Detailed mapping of HELM capabilities to each cell in matrix
