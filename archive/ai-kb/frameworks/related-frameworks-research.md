# Related Frameworks & Competitive Landscape Research

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Purpose:** Research on related executive frameworks, industry-specific approaches, competitive products positioned as "Executive OS," and how the HELM framework compares

---

## Executive Summary

This research examines:
1. **Existing "Executive OS" concepts** - Has anyone positioned a product/framework this way?
2. **Related executive frameworks** - Balanced Scorecard, OKRs, North Star Metrics, and how they apply to our three industries
3. **Industry-specific executive tools** - What do healthcare/SaaS/nonprofit executives currently use?
4. **Competitive positioning opportunities** - Where HELM can differentiate

**Key Finding:** No major product is positioned as a comprehensive "Executive Operating System." Most tools address single functions (e.g., goal-setting with OKRs, scorecarding with Balanced Scorecard) rather than the full Sense → Understand → Decide → Execute cycle across all domains. This represents a positioning opportunity.

## 1. Existing "Executive Operating System" Concepts

### Chief Executive Operating System (CEO-S)
**Provider:** CEO-S (ceosys.co)
**Created by:** Joel Trammell & Sherif Sakr
**Focus:** CEO training and development

**What it is:**
- A framework and training program for CEOs
- Delivers a "concise, systematic guide to being a truly great chief executive"
- Provides structure, focus, and cadence for CEO decision-making
- Book: "The Chief Executive Operating System" (2023)

**Key Components:**
- Agile decision-making framework
- Goal alignment across the organization
- Predictive operating rhythm
- Executive training and tools

**Comparison to HELM Executive OS:**
- **Similarities:** Both position as "operating systems" for executives
- **Differences:** CEO-S is training/coaching focused (not software); targets CEOs specifically vs all C-suite; more about leadership development than day-to-day operational intelligence
- **Opportunity:** HELM addresses the tactical/operational layer that CEO-S principles require (data, insights, workflows)

### EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System)
**Provider:** EOS Worldwide
**Created by:** Gino Wickman
**Focus:** Holistic business management system for entrepreneurial companies

**What it is:**
- Complete business management system with 6 components: Vision, People, Data, Issues, Process, Traction
- Implemented through coaching and tools (90-day planning, weekly meetings, accountability charts)
- Book series: "Traction," "Get a Grip"

**Key Components:**
- Vision/Traction Organizer (V/TO): Strategic planning document
- Accountability Chart: Clear roles and responsibilities
- Scorecard: Weekly metrics tracking
- Rocks: Quarterly priorities (3-7 per person)
- Level 10 Meeting: Weekly leadership meeting structure

**Comparison to HELM Executive OS:**
- **Similarities:** Holistic system, emphasis on data-driven decisions, accountability
- **Differences:** EOS is process/meeting focused (not technology); targets $2-50M entrepreneurial companies; implemented via coaching vs software
- **Opportunity:** HELM could enable EOS scorecards/metrics with real-time data vs manual tracking

### TeamOps (GitLab)
**Provider:** GitLab
**Focus:** Decision-making velocity for all-remote organizations

**What it is:**
- Operating model for distributed teams emphasizing decision velocity
- Documents how to make decisions at the appropriate level
- Focuses on asynchronous communication, transparency, and iteration

**Key Principles:**
- Everyone can contribute
- Write down all decisions
- Bias for action (two-way vs one-way doors)
- Appropriate decision velocity by pace layer

**Comparison to HELM Executive OS:**
- **Similarities:** Emphasizes decision velocity, connects to pace layers (fast/medium/slow)
- **Differences:** Process/culture focused (not executive-specific); no domain framework; targets engineering culture
- **Opportunity:** HELM applies decision velocity concepts to executive decision-making specifically

**Assessment:** None of these are software products positioned as "Executive OS" in the same way HELM could be. CEO-S is closest but is a training/coaching business, not a SaaS platform.

## 2. Related Executive Frameworks

### 2.1 Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan & Norton)

**Origin:** Robert Kaplan & David Norton, Harvard Business School, 1992

**Core Concept:** Organizations should measure performance across 4 perspectives, not just financial:
1. **Financial:** Shareholder value, profitability, ROI
2. **Customer:** Satisfaction, retention, market share
3. **Internal Business Processes:** Quality, efficiency, innovation
4. **Learning & Growth:** Employee capabilities, systems, organizational culture

**How It Works:**
- Define strategy and strategic objectives
- For each objective, identify metrics (KPIs), targets, and initiatives
- Create "strategy map" showing cause-effect relationships
- Monitor leading (drivers) and lagging (outcomes) indicators

**Industry Adoption:**

#### Healthcare Applications
- **Widespread use:** Duke Children's Hospital (first healthcare adopter in 2000) "converted $11M losses into $4M profit"
- BSC adapted to healthcare contexts with healthcare-specific metrics (patient outcomes, clinical quality, regulatory compliance)
- Challenge: Differences between profit and nonprofit hospitals complicate standardization
- **Platform:** ClearPoint Strategy (SaaS platform) specifically supports healthcare BSC implementation

#### SaaS Applications
- Less common in SaaS vs other industries
- When used, typically maps to:
  - Financial → ARR growth, profitability, Rule of 40
  - Customer → NPS, NRR, churn
  - Internal → Product development velocity, uptime, engineering efficiency
  - Learning & Growth → Innovation pipeline, employee retention, skill development
- **Challenge:** Fast-moving SaaS companies prefer more agile frameworks (OKRs)

#### Nonprofit Applications
- Common in educational institutions, healthcare nonprofits, sports organizations
- Adaptation: Need to directly measure **mission** within BSC (not just financial outcomes)
- Four perspectives often reframed:
  - Mission/Impact (replaces Financial as primary)
  - Beneficiary/Stakeholder (replaces Customer)
  - Internal Processes
  - Organizational Capacity (replaces Learning & Growth)
- **Tool:** Bloomerang offers nonprofit-specific BSC templates

**Comparison to HELM Executive OS:**
- **Similarities:** Multi-domain perspective (BSC's 4 vs HELM's 5 domains), connects strategy to metrics
- **Differences:** BSC is strategic planning/measurement framework, not operational intelligence; doesn't explicitly model Sense→Understand→Decide→Execute flow
- **Opportunity:** HELM could be the operational layer that delivers real-time BSC metrics and insights

### 2.2 OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

**Origin:** Andy Grove (Intel), popularized by John Doerr (Google investor)

**Core Concept:** Set ambitious objectives with measurable key results
- **Objective:** Qualitative, inspirational goal (e.g., "Become the category leader in enterprise SaaS")
- **Key Results:** 3-5 quantitative metrics that prove objective is achieved (e.g., "Increase NRR from 105% to 120%")

**How It Works:**
- Set company OKRs quarterly (sometimes annually for strategic OKRs)
- Cascade to team and individual OKRs (aligned but not strictly hierarchical)
- Score OKRs weekly/monthly, aim for 70-80% achievement (stretch goals)
- Transparent: Everyone's OKRs visible across company

**Industry Adoption:**

#### Healthcare Payers
- **Growing adoption:** Oracle offers Healthcare Foundation platform supporting OKRs for payers
- OKR Examples:
  - Objective: "Achieve 4.5 Star Rating"
    - KR1: Improve diabetic eye exam completion from 65% to 85%
    - KR2: Increase mammography screening from 70% to 80%
    - KR3: Reduce pharmacy medication errors by 40%
- **Challenge:** Regulatory metrics (HEDIS, Star Ratings) are annual, not quarterly, creating mismatch with OKR cadence

#### Enterprise SaaS
- **Highly prevalent:** SaaS startups and scaleups widely adopt OKRs
- OKR Examples:
  - Objective: "Achieve product-market fit in enterprise segment"
    - KR1: Sign 10 customers with >$100K ACV
    - KR2: Achieve 90-day NRR >110% in enterprise cohort
    - KR3: NPS >50 from enterprise customers
- **Tools:** Lattice, 15Five, Perdoo, WorkBoard (OKR software for SaaS)
- **Trend:** Combining OKRs with product-led growth metrics

#### Nonprofits
- **Increasing adoption:** Nonprofits embrace OKRs for mission-driven accountability
- Benefits: Ambitious stretch goals, outcomes-based (not activities), transparency, alignment
- OKR Examples:
  - Objective: "Double our impact in underserved communities"
    - KR1: Serve 10K beneficiaries (up from 5K)
    - KR2: Achieve 85% program completion rate
    - KR3: Raise $15M to fund expansion
- **Free tools:** Google Sheets templates, free versions of Weekdone, 10xWinners
- **Adaptation:** Nonprofits balance growth OKRs with sustainability OKRs (reserves, efficiency)

**Comparison to HELM Executive OS:**
- **Similarities:** Goal-setting and tracking, transparency, outcome focus
- **Differences:** OKRs are goal management (Decide/Execute), don't address Sense/Understand; don't provide operational intelligence
- **Opportunity:** HELM could surface insights that inform OKR setting and track metrics that feed into Key Results

### 2.3 North Star Metric Framework

**Origin:** Popularized by growth-stage startups (Airbnb, Facebook, Amplitude)

**Core Concept:** Identify the ONE metric that best captures customer value and predicts business success
- North Star should drive revenue, reflect customer value, and track progress
- Supported by 3-5 "input metrics" that drive the North Star

**Examples:**
- **Airbnb:** Nights booked
- **Facebook:** Daily Active Users (DAU)
- **Slack:** Messages sent in workspaces
- **HubSpot:** Contacts added to system

**How It Works:**
1. Identify the moment of customer value ("aha moment")
2. Define metric that measures that value delivery
3. Identify 3-5 input metrics that drive the North Star
4. Align entire organization around moving the North Star
5. Track inputs daily/weekly, North Star weekly/monthly

**Industry Application:**

#### Healthcare Payers
- No standard "North Star" documented in research
- Candidates: Member retention (predicts all other metrics), Star Rating (drives quality and revenue)
- Challenge: Multiple stakeholders (members, providers, employers, regulators) complicate single-metric focus

#### Enterprise SaaS
- **Highly relevant:** Most B2B SaaS companies define a North Star
- Common choices:
  - **Product-led:** Active users, teams using product daily
  - **Sales-led:** ARR (though more outcome than value metric)
  - **Best practice:** Usage metric that predicts expansion (e.g., "teams with 3+ active users in first week")
- **Amplitude's Framework:** Provides North Star playbook for SaaS companies

#### Nonprofits
- Less common terminology but similar concept as "mission metric"
- Examples:
  - Education nonprofit: Students graduating
  - Health nonprofit: Lives saved or improved
  - Advocacy org: Policies changed affecting X people
- Challenge: Long lag times between intervention and impact

**Comparison to HELM Executive OS:**
- **Similarities:** Focus on key outcomes, simplicity for alignment
- **Differences:** Single-metric focus vs multi-domain; doesn't address operational complexity
- **Opportunity:** HELM shows how 4×5 matrix activities drive toward North Star outcome

### 2.4 Three Horizons Framework (McKinsey)

**Origin:** McKinsey & Company, "The Alchemy of Growth" (1999)

**Core Concept:** Manage portfolio across three time horizons simultaneously
- **Horizon 1:** Defend/extend core business (0-2 years, most profit today)
- **Horizon 2:** Build emerging growth engines (2-5 years, investing for future)
- **Horizon 3:** Create options for transformation (5+ years, small bets on future)

**Resource Allocation:** Typical mix is 70% H1, 20% H2, 10% H3 (varies by context)

**Industry Application:**
- Applies broadly across industries for portfolio management
- Healthcare payers use for: H1 = optimize current plans, H2 = new product lines (e.g., D-SNP), H3 = value-based care transformation
- SaaS companies use for: H1 = current product optimization, H2 = new modules/markets, H3 = platform/AI bets
- Nonprofits use for: H1 = current programs, H2 = new geographies/populations, H3 = policy advocacy for systems change

**Comparison to HELM Executive OS:**
- **Similarities:** HELM's Time dimension incorporates Three Horizons thinking
- **Differences:** Three Horizons is portfolio management, not operational framework
- **Integration:** HELM Executive OS explicitly includes Three Horizons as the temporal dimension

### 2.5 OODA Loop (John Boyd)

**Origin:** Colonel John Boyd, US Air Force, 1990s (military strategy)

**Core Concept:** Decision-making cycle for competitive environments
- **Observe:** Gather information from the environment
- **Orient:** Make sense of information in context (most important step)
- **Decide:** Determine course of action
- **Act:** Execute decision, observe results, repeat

**Key Insight:** Whoever completes the OODA loop faster wins (decision velocity advantage)

**Business Adoption:**
- Widely referenced in strategy, less often formally implemented
- Most relevant in fast-moving, competitive environments (startups, turnarounds)

**Comparison to HELM Executive OS:**
- **Similarities:** HELM's 4 Functions (Sense, Understand, Decide, Execute) directly map to OODA
- **Differences:** HELM adds domain structure (5 domains) and explicit time horizons
- **Integration:** HELM is essentially OODA Loop applied to executive work across domains and time

## 4. Competitive Positioning Analysis

### Current Market Gaps

#### Gap 1: No Unified Executive Intelligence Platform
**What exists:**
- Point solutions for each function (CRM, BI, OKR software, customer success)
- Generic BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) require heavy customization

**What's missing:**
- Pre-built executive intelligence that understands healthcare/SaaS/nonprofit context
- Unified view connecting Market → Process → People → Technology → Finance
- AI-powered insights that say "Here's what's happening and why it matters"

**HELM Opportunity:** Position as the first industry-aware Executive Operating System that delivers pre-built intelligence

#### Gap 2: Disconnected Strategy from Operations
**What exists:**
- Strategic planning tools (ClearPoint, OKR software) live separately from operational data
- Executives manually connect strategy to daily operations

**What's missing:**
- Real-time feedback loop from operational data to strategic dashboards
- Automatic surfacing of: "Your OKR is at risk because..." or "Star Rating improvement initiative is underperforming because..."

**HELM Opportunity:** Connect strategy layer (goals, OKRs, scorecard) to operational reality automatically

#### Gap 3: Reactive vs Predictive Intelligence
**What exists:**
- Dashboards show what happened (lagging indicators)
- Alerts trigger when thresholds crossed (reactive)

**What's missing:**
- Predictive: "Member churn likely to increase 15% next quarter based on..."
- Prescriptive: "To improve NRR from 105% to 110%, focus on X customer segment with Y intervention"

**HELM Opportunity:** AI-powered predictive and prescriptive insights, not just descriptive dashboards

#### Gap 4: Industry Context Missing from Generic Tools
**What exists:**
- Tableau/Power BI can build any dashboard but require expertise
- Requires knowing: What should healthcare/SaaS/nonprofit executives measure?

**What's missing:**
- Out-of-box dashboards that understand healthcare MLR, SaaS Magic Number, nonprofit program ratios
- Industry benchmarks and peer comparisons
- Best practice KPIs pre-configured

**HELM Opportunity:** Industry-specific intelligence (not just industry-agnostic BI)

---

## 5. Positioning Recommendations for HELM

### Primary Positioning: "The Executive Operating System"

**Tagline:** "Your operating system for running [Healthcare Payer / SaaS Company / Nonprofit Foundation]"

**Key Messages:**
1. **Unified Intelligence:** Connect strategy to operations to outcomes in one system (not 5 disconnected tools)
2. **Industry-Native:** Built for your industry (healthcare/SaaS/nonprofit), not generic BI you have to customize
3. **4×5 Framework:** Sense → Understand → Decide → Execute across Market, Process, People, Technology, Finance
4. **AI-Powered:** Predictive insights, not just backward-looking dashboards

### Differentiation vs Existing Frameworks

| Framework | What It Does | What It Doesn't Do | How HELM Complements |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Balanced Scorecard** | Strategic measurement across 4 perspectives | Doesn't provide real-time data or operational intelligence | HELM delivers live BSC metrics + operational drivers |
| **OKRs** | Goal-setting and tracking | Doesn't surface insights or connect goals to operational data | HELM shows why OKRs are at risk and what to do |
| **North Star Metric** | Alignment around single key metric | Doesn't show operational drivers or multi-domain complexity | HELM shows 4×5 activities that drive North Star |
| **Three Horizons** | Portfolio management across time | Doesn't provide data or insights for each horizon | HELM tracks H1/H2/H3 initiatives with real-time data |

### Differentiation vs Existing Tools

| Tool Category | What It Does | What It Doesn't Do | How HELM Differentiates |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **BI Tools (Tableau, Power BI)** | Flexible dashboarding from any data source | Generic (no industry context); requires heavy customization | Industry-specific intelligence out-of-box |
| **Subscription Analytics (Baremetrics)** | SaaS metrics tracking | SaaS-only; metrics reporting, not insights; no cross-domain view | Multi-domain intelligence (not just finance) |
| **Customer Success Platforms (Gainsight)** | Customer health & retention tracking | Point solution (customer domain only) | Connects customer health to product, people, tech, finance |
| **OKR Software (Lattice)** | Goal tracking and alignment | No operational intelligence or insights on why goals at risk | Connects OKRs to real-time operational drivers |

### Target Positioning by Industry

#### Healthcare Payers
**Positioning:** "The operating system for value-based health plans"
**Key Pain:** Disconnected systems (claims, quality, finance, network) prevent executives from seeing full picture
**HELM Value:** Unified view of MLR, Star Ratings, member satisfaction, network adequacy with AI insights on improvement opportunities

#### Enterprise SaaS
**Positioning:** "Your Growth Operating System: Drive ARR, NRR, and Rule of 40"
**Key Pain:** Fragmented metrics across sales, customer success, product, finance make it hard to see what's actually driving growth
**HELM Value:** Unified SaaS metrics (ARR, NRR, Magic Number, Rule of 40) with insights on growth bottlenecks and expansion opportunities

#### Nonprofits/Foundations
**Positioning:** "Mission Control: Maximize impact while maintaining donor trust"
**Key Pain:** Juggling donor CRM, program databases, impact measurement, financials in separate systems
**HELM Value:** Unified view of impact outcomes, donor health, program efficiency, financial sustainability with transparency for board/donors

- **Data warehouse integration:** Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift for custom data models

---

## 7. Key Research Insights

### 1. "Executive OS" Terminology Is Available
- CEO-S uses it but for training/coaching (not software)
- No major SaaS product claims "Executive Operating System" positioning
- **Opportunity:** HELM can own this positioning in software category

### 2. Executives Use Multiple Frameworks Simultaneously
- Not "Balanced Scorecard vs OKRs" but "BSC AND OKRs AND North Star"
- Each addresses different needs: BSC (measurement), OKRs (goals), North Star (alignment)
- **Opportunity:** HELM as the platform that supports all frameworks (not replacing them)

### 3. Industry Context Matters Enormously
- Generic BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) require months of customization
- Executives want pre-built intelligence: "Just show me my Star Rating drivers" or "Why is my Magic Number declining?"
- **Opportunity:** Industry-specific intelligence is a major differentiator

### 4. Fragmentation Is the Enemy
- Healthcare payer CEO uses: Epic (operations), Cotiviti (quality), Tableau (dashboards), PowerPoint (board)
- SaaS CEO uses: Baremetrics (metrics), Gainsight (customers), Mosaic (finance), Lattice (OKRs)
- Nonprofit ED uses: Salesforce (donors), Apricot (programs), QuickBooks (finance), BoardEffect (board)
- **Pain Point:** Too many tools, no unified intelligence
- **Opportunity:** HELM as the unified executive intelligence layer

### 5. AI/Insights Are the Differentiator
- Existing tools provide data and dashboards but limited insights
- Executives want: "Why is this happening?" and "What should I do?"
- **Opportunity:** HELM's AI-powered predictive and prescriptive insights are category-defining

---

## 8. Recommended Next Steps

### For Product Strategy
1. **Validate industry pain:** Interviews with 10 executives per industry on current tools, pain points, desired intelligence
