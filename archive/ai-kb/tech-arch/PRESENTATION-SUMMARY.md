## Presentation Structure

### Slide 1: Title
**"Context Graphs: HELM's Path to Organizational Memory"**
- Bold, modern design with deep navy background
- Tagline: "Transforming AI agents from stateless tools into continuously learning decision-makers"
- Sets professional, innovation-focused tone

### Slide 2: The "Amnesiac Agent" Problem
**Problem Statement**
- No organizational memory
- Black box decisions
- Repeated mistakes
- Compliance theater

*Establishes the pain point enterprises are experiencing*

### Slide 3: HELM's Solution - Context Graphs
**Three Pillars:**
1. **Automatic Capture** - Every execution enriches the graph
2. **Precedent-Based** - Agents query past decisions
3. **Explainable** - Evidence chains for audits

*Introduces the solution architecture*

### Slide 4: Technical Architecture
**Core Components:**
- Task Nodes, Evidence Nodes, Policy Nodes
- Decision Links, Precedent Links
- Integration: Graph writer + GraphRAG + Neo4j + Hybrid search

**Visual:** Architecture flow diagram showing 5 layers from execution to AI context assembly

*Technical credibility for engineering/CTO audience*

### Slide 5: Real Example - Compliance Query
**Query:** "Why was Task #T-1234 approved for $10K refund when policy limit is $5K?"

**Context Graph Returns:**
- Policy context (exception rules)
- Evidence (4 outages, SLA contract)
- Precedent (similar case 60 days ago)
- Approval chain (agent → manager → VP)
- Confidence score (0.92 - High)

*Concrete demonstration of value*

### Slide 6: Market Positioning
**Positioning:** "The organizational memory system that makes AI agents trustworthy, auditable, and continuously learning"

**Competitive Differentiation:**
- vs. Salesforce AgentForce: Cross-system memory (not siloed)
- vs. LangChain/AutoGPT: Governed precedents (not just frameworks)
- vs. Aporia/Arthur: Proactive learning (not just monitoring)

*Clear competitive positioning*

### Slide 7: Revenue Model & Growth
**Pricing Tiers:**
- Base HELM License: $50K/year
- Context Graph Add-On: $100K/year
- Enterprise Tier: $500K/year

**Visual Chart:** Revenue growth trajectory
- Q2 2026: 10 customers → $1M ARR
- Q3 2026: 30 customers → $3M ARR
- Q4 2026: 100 customers → $15M ARR
- Q1 2027: 250 customers → $50M ARR

*Financial projections and business model*

### Slide 8: 90-Day Roadmap
**4 Phases:**
1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-4): Neo4j setup, core schema, basic queries
2. **Evidence** (Weeks 5-8): Evidence nodes, provenance, audit trails
3. **Precedents** (Weeks 9-12): GraphRAG engine, agent integration
4. **Learning** (Weeks 13-16): Temporal reasoning, pattern extraction

*Clear execution plan*

### Slide 9: Investment Thesis
**Why Now?**
- Market Timing: 2026 = "year of agent deployment"
- Technical Feasibility: Mature graph DBs, validated research
- Competitive Window: 12-18 month head start

**Call to Action:** "From compliance tool → organizational brain"

*Strategic importance and urgency*
