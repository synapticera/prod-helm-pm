## ROI Calculation for HR AI

### Cost per HR Inquiry

```
HR_Cost_Per_Inquiry = HR_Team_Cost / Annual_Inquiries
                    = $500,000 / 50,000 = $10/inquiry (example)
```

### AI Savings Calculation

```
Annual_Savings = AI_Handled_Inquiries × (Human_Cost - AI_Cost)
               = 40,000 × ($10 - $0.50)
               = $380,000
```

### Productivity Value

```
Productivity_Value = Employees × Hours_Saved × Hourly_Rate
                   = 10,000 employees × 2 hrs/year × $50/hr
                   = $1,000,000
```
