## The Prior Authorization Problem

### Industry Statistics

- **$35 billion** annual PA administrative spending in US
- **45 PAs per physician per week** (average practice)
- **14 hours per week** staff time on PA per practice
- **$11,000 per physician** annual PA-related admin cost
- **2-14 days** average PA processing time

### Traditional PA Process Pain Points

1. Manual fax/phone submission (60% of PAs)
2. Missing or incomplete information
3. Clinical criteria lookup
4. Manual clinical review
5. Provider callback delays
6. Denial and appeal cycles

---

## AI-Enabled PA Workflow

### Before AI (Traditional)

```
Provider Request (Fax/Phone) → Manual Intake → Information Gaps →
Provider Callback → Clinical Review → Decision → Notification
Timeline: 2-14 days average
```

### After AI (Cohere Model)

```
Provider Request (Portal) → AI Clinical Check → Auto-Approve (90%)
                                              → Medical Review (10%)
Timeline: 85% real-time decisions
```

## ROI Calculation for PA AI

### Cost per PA Transaction

| Party                 | Traditional Cost | AI-Enabled Cost |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Payer (processing)    | $15-25           | $1-5            |
| Provider (submission) | $20-30           | $5-10           |
| **Total System**      | **$35-55**       | **$6-15**       |

### Cohere Health ROI Model (from case study)

```
Processing Cost Reduction: 47%
Admin Staff Time Reduction: 61% (data entry)
Real-Time Decisions: 85% (vs <5% traditional)
Provider Satisfaction: 93%
Auto-Approval Rate: 90%
```

### Example ROI Calculation

```
Annual PA Requests: 5,000,000
Traditional Cost: 5M × $20 = $100,000,000
AI-Enabled Cost: 5M × $6 = $30,000,000
Annual Savings: $70,000,000

Implementation Cost: $5,000,000
First Year ROI: ($70M - $5M) / $5M = 1,300%
```

## Key Success Factors

1. **Clinical AI Accuracy**: AI must match clinical criteria correctly
2. **Provider Portal Adoption**: Digital submission critical for automation
3. **EHR Integration**: Auto-pull of clinical data reduces friction
4. **Real-Time Decisions**: Speed is primary value proposition
5. **Transparency**: Clear denial reasons and appeal paths
6. **Compliance**: CMS and state PA reform requirements

---

## Regulatory Context

### CMS PA Reforms (2024-2026)

- Electronic PA requirements
- Decision timeframes mandated
- Denial reason transparency
- Prior auth data reporting

### State-Level Reforms

- Gold carding (auto-approval for high-performing providers)
- PA elimination for certain services
- Expedited review requirements
- Step therapy restrictions
