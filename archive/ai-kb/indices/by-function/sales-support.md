## Sales AI ROI Patterns

### Direct Revenue Generation

```
Revenue = AI_Conversations × Conversion_Rate × Average_Order_Value

Example (Simba Sleep):
= 100K conversations × 6% × £100 = £600K monthly
```

### Lead Qualification Value

```
Lead_Value = Qualified_Leads × Close_Rate × Deal_Value

Example (Housing.com):
= 11x more engaged leads × higher close rate × property value
```

### Cross-Sell Lift

```
Lift_Value = Transactions × Cross_Sell_Rate_Improvement × Avg_Add-On

Example (UK Telco):
= Millions of calls × 10% improvement × add-on value
```
