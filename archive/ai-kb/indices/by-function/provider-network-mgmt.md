1. Incorrect phone numbers/addresses
2. Outdated specialty information
3. Wrong office hours
4. Incorrect network participation status
5. "Ghost providers" (listed but not accepting patients)
6. Missing NPI/license information

## ROI Calculation for Provider Network AI

### Cost per Credentialing

| Process                | Traditional | AI-Enabled | Savings  |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Application Processing | $50         | $10        | $40      |
| Primary Source Verify  | $100        | $15        | $85      |
| Document Management    | $75         | $5         | $70      |
| Committee Review       | $50         | $0         | $50      |
| Ongoing Monitoring     | $25         | $5         | $20      |
| **Total**              | **$300**    | **$35**    | **$265** |

### Example ROI (50K Providers)

```
Annual Credentialing Volume: 50,000
Traditional Cost: 50K × $300 = $15,000,000
AI-Enabled Cost: 50K × $35 = $1,750,000
Annual Savings: $13,250,000

Directory Accuracy Improvement: 70% → 95%
Avoided No Surprises Act Penalties: $500,000
Avoided Member Complaints: $250,000
Additional Value: $750,000

Total Annual Value: $14,000,000
Implementation: $500,000
First Year ROI: ($14M - $0.5M) / $0.5M = 2,700%
```
