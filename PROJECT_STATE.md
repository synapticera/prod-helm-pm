# Project State

## Current Feature
- **Branch**: main (bplan enhancements)
- **Phase**: WAITING_FOR_DECISION
- **Started**: Jan 5, 2026
- **Feature**: EU AI Act Strategic Opportunity Execution Framework

## Progress
- [x] Requirements gathered (EU AI Act market research complete)
- [x] Design approved (three strategic paths analyzed)
- [x] Strategic analysis documents created (2 documents)
- [x] Decision framework created (visual strategy selector)
- [x] Messaging playbook created (ready to activate)
- [x] Implementation roadmap created (month-by-month execution)
- [ ] Awaiting leadership decision on strategic path

## Current Task
- **ID**: EU-AI-ACT-001
- **Description**: Await leadership decision on strategic path (Path 1, 2, or 3)
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting for user input)
- **Owner**: Leadership team

## Completed Tasks
1. EU-AI-ACT-RESEARCH - Create EU AI Act governance research (commit 7821d9d)
2. EU-AI-ACT-OPPORTUNITIES - Create strategic opportunities analysis (commit 7821d9d)
3. EU-AI-ACT-STRATEGY-SELECTOR - Create visual decision framework (commit cb6e3bc)
4. EU-AI-ACT-MESSAGING-PLAYBOOK - Create compliance messaging variants (commit cb6e3bc)
5. EU-AI-ACT-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP - Create execution roadmap for all paths (commit c632a1b)
6. README-UPDATE - Update bplan README with new documents and opportunity context (commit 1bc34f3)

## Blockers
- **Awaiting Leadership Decision**: Which strategic path to pursue (Aggressive Compliance, Balanced Compliance+Strategy, or Productivity-Only)

## Notes
- **Previous Session Work**: Positioning shifted to "Executive Agent for Service Leaders" (primary) with "Decision Intelligence" as supporting technical language
- **Market Inflection**: August 2, 2026 is key regulatory deadline creating €500M-1B opportunity window
- **Recommended Path**: Path 2 (Balanced Compliance + Strategy) - captures immediate compliance urgency + long-term €11B TAM expansion
- **Execution Window**: 7 months (Jan-Aug 2026) with three distinct phases in Path 2

## Key Decisions Log

| Jan 5, 2026 | Create EU AI Act strategic opportunity framework | Aug 2, 2026 deadline creates unique market inflection requiring urgent GTM decision | Three strategic paths analyzed with path-specific execution roadmaps |
