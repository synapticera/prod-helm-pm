## Failure Rates & Implementation Challenges

### MIT Research: 95% GenAI Project Failure Rate

**Source:** [MIT NANDA Study - "The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025"](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/)

**Lead Researcher:** Aditya Challapally, MIT Project NANDA

**Key Findings:**

- **95% of GenAI pilots** have no measurable impact on P&L
- Only **5% of AI pilot programs** achieve rapid revenue acceleration
- Research based on **150 interviews**, **350 employee survey responses**, and **300 public AI deployments**

**Root Causes:**

- **The Learning Gap**: Generic tools like ChatGPT excel for individuals but stall in enterprise use because they don't learn from or adapt to workflows
- **Budget Misallocation**: >50% of GenAI budgets devoted to sales and marketing tools, yet MIT found biggest ROI in back-office automation
- **Build vs. Buy**: Internal builds succeed only 1/3 as often as purchasing specialized tools and partnerships

**Success Factors:**

- Purchasing AI tools from specialized vendors: **67% success rate**
- Building partnerships with vendors who use their tools: **67% success rate**
- Internal builds: **33% success rate**
- Pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly

### Gartner: 40% Agentic AI Project Cancellation by 2027

**Source:** [Gartner Press Release - June 25, 2025](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027)

**Key Analyst:** Anushree Verma, Senior Director Analyst at Gartner

**Prediction:**

- **>40% of agentic AI projects** will be canceled by end of 2027
- Reasons: Escalating costs, unclear business value, inadequate risk controls

**The "Agent Washing" Problem:**

- Gartner estimates only **~130 of thousands of agentic AI vendors are real**
- Many vendors rebranding existing products (AI assistants, RPA, chatbots) without substantial agentic capabilities

**Root Causes:**

- Most agentic AI projects are **early stage experiments or POCs** driven by hype
- Often misapplied, blinding organizations to real cost and complexity of deploying at scale
- Stalls projects from moving into production

**Current Investment Landscape (January 2025 Gartner poll, n=3,412):**

- **19%** made significant investments in agentic AI
- **42%** made conservative investments
- **8%** no investments
- **31%** taking wait-and-see approach or unsure

**Optimistic Outlook Despite Failures:**

- Gartner predicts **≥15% of day-to-day work decisions** will be made autonomously through agentic AI by 2028
- Up from **0% in 2024**

## Market Predictions & Forecasts

### McKinsey: Seizing the Agentic AI Advantage

**Source:** [McKinsey CEO Playbook - 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage)

**The Gen AI Paradox:**

- **~80%** of companies report using gen AI
- **~80%** report no significant bottom-line impact

**Root Cause - Imbalance:**

- **"Horizontal" copilots/chatbots** (enterprise-wide): Scaled quickly but deliver diffuse, hard-to-measure gains
- **"Vertical" function-specific use cases**: **~90% stuck in pilot mode** despite being more transformative

**What Are AI Agents:**
Software systems built with gen AI that have the ability to:

- Plan
- Act
- Remember
- Learn to achieve predefined outcomes autonomously

**Value Proposition:**

- Shift gen AI from reactive tool to proactive, goal-driven virtual collaborator
- Potential to automate complex business processes combining autonomy, planning, memory, and integration

**Early Results - Logistics:**

- Autonomous routing and scheduling in logistics operations
- **>20% drop in inventory and logistics costs** (McKinsey research)

### Sequoia Capital: AI Ascent 2025 - The Agent Economy Emerges

**Source:** [Sequoia AI Ascent 2025 Conference](https://sequoiacap.com/article/ai-ascent-2025/)

**Core Paradigm Shift:**
Emergence of an **"Agent Economy"** where AI agents not only communicate information but:

- Transfer resources
- Make transactions
- Develop their own economic relationships

**Three Acts Framework (Sonya Huang, Sequoia Partner):**

| Act           | Timeline  | Characteristics                                                    |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Act One**   | 2022-2023 | Lightweight novelty applications                                   |
| **Act Two**   | 2023-2024 | Reasoning models, multimodal interfaces                            |
| **Act Three** | 2025+     | **Vertical agents** - AI trained end-to-end for specific workflows |

**2025 as Turning Point:**

- AI graduated from **"answer engine"** to **"action engine"** in the workplace
- First year agents do real work
- Fundamentally redefining:
  - Enterprise workflows
  - Customer service
  - Sales operations

**Market Opportunity:**

- AI attacking **both software and services markets simultaneously**
- Profit pool **at least an order of magnitude larger** than previous tech transitions
- Evolution: Tools → Copilots → **Autopilots**

**New Business Models:**

- **Outcomes-based pricing**: Pay when AI agent resolves issues autonomously
- Example: Sierra (customer service agents)

**Sequoia's Strategic Emphasis:**

- "Tremendous sucking sound in the market" for AI
- Importance of going "at maximum velocity, all of the time"
- Partner Konstantin Buhler: Focus on agent economy infrastructure
