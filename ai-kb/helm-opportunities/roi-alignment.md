## Part 1: Cost Savings

### How Helm Drives Cost Savings

| Mechanism                  | Description                                      | Impact Range                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Agent Optimization**     | Identify where agents are deployed inefficiently | 10-15% cost reduction          |
| **Waste Reduction**        | Find queries routed to wrong agents/channels     | 5-10% efficiency gain          |
| **Exception Reduction**    | Reduce human intervention through better design  | 15-20% handling cost reduction |
| **Vendor Rationalization** | Identify redundant agent investments             | 5-15% vendor spend reduction   |

### Mine Module Contribution

**Capability:** Decision trace capture and analysis
**Cost Impact:**

- Identify where agents fail unnecessarily (false negatives)
- Find queries that should be automated but aren't
- Discover routing inefficiencies
- Track cost per decision across agent types

**Example Calculation:**

```
Current: 100,000 monthly interactions
- Human-handled (60%): 60,000 @ $7.50 = $450,000
- Agent-handled (40%): 40,000 @ $0.50 = $20,000
Total: $470,000/month

With Helm Optimization (Mine insights):
- Human-handled (45%): 45,000 @ $7.50 = $337,500
- Agent-handled (55%): 55,000 @ $0.50 = $27,500
Total: $365,000/month

Monthly Savings: $105,000 (22% reduction)
Annual Savings: $1.26M
```

| **Workflow Redesign**        | Optimize human-AI collaboration          | 20-30% throughput increase         |
| **Exception Prioritization** | Route high-value exceptions first        | 15-25% efficiency gain             |
| **Skill Matching**           | Route complex cases to right specialists | 10-15% resolution rate improvement |
| **Continuous Improvement**   | Learn from decision patterns             | 5-10% ongoing efficiency gain      |

### Design Module Contribution

**Capability:** Data-driven workflow optimization
**Productivity Impact:**

- Optimize case routing based on actual decision patterns
- Identify where human review is unnecessary
- Design exception handling that reduces rework

**Example Calculation:**

```
Current: 100 service representatives
- Effective capacity: 80% (20% on non-value work)
- Effective team: 80 FTE equivalents

With Helm Design (workflow optimization):
- Effective capacity: 95% (5% on non-value work)
- Effective team: 95 FTE equivalents

Productivity Gain: 15 FTE equivalents
At $75K fully loaded cost: $1.125M annual value
```

| **Outcome Tracking**       | Monitor actual resolution quality   | 10-15% CSAT improvement          |

### Manage Module Contribution

**Capability:** Policy enforcement and quality governance
**Quality Impact:**

- Enforce response guidelines across all agents
- Detect policy violations in real-time
- Track quality metrics at decision level
- Enable continuous quality improvement

**Example Calculation:**

```
Current CSAT: 78%
Industry benchmark: 85%
Customer lifetime value: $5,000
Annual customers served: 50,000

Current CSAT revenue impact:
- Churn due to poor CSAT: ~15% elevated churn
- Lost customers: 7,500 annually
- Lost CLV: $37.5M

With Helm Quality Improvement (85% CSAT):
- Reduced churn: 10% vs 15%
- Retained customers: 2,500 additional
- Retained CLV: $12.5M

Annual Quality Value: $12.5M saved from churn
```

Current churn rate: 15%
Churn revenue loss: $1.5M annually

With Helm CX Improvement:
- New churn rate: 12%
- Churn revenue loss: $1.2M

Annual Retained Revenue: $300K
3-Year Revenue Impact: $900K+

| **Audit Trail**               | Complete decision documentation | Reduced legal exposure       |
| **Governance Infrastructure** | Foundation for AI scaling       | Enable future AI investments |
| **Competitive Positioning**   | First-mover in governance       | Market differentiation       |

### Regulatory Risk Quantification

**EU AI Act Risk Assessment:**

| Violation Category          | Potential Fine                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Prohibited AI practices     | Up to €35M or 7% of global revenue    |
| High-risk system violations | Up to €15M or 3% of global revenue    |
| Incorrect information       | Up to €7.5M or 1.5% of global revenue |

**For a $500M revenue company:**

- Maximum exposure: $35M (7% of revenue)
- Helm governance as insurance: Compliance infrastructure

**Risk Value Calculation:**

```
Probability of violation without governance: 15%
Expected fine: $5M (average case)
Expected loss without Helm: $750K annually

Probability with Helm governance: 2%
Expected loss with Helm: $100K

Annual Risk Mitigation Value: $650K
