## Claims Processing Workflow with AI

### Traditional Workflow

```
FNOL → Document Collection → Review → Decision → Payment → Close
       (Manual each step, days-weeks total)
```

### AI-Enabled Workflow

```
FNOL (AI intake) → Auto-Document (OCR/AI) → AI Adjudication → Auto-Pay → Close
                   (Simple claims: minutes-hours)

                   → Human Review (Complex) → Decision → Payment → Close
                   (Complex claims: reduced by 50%+)
```

## ROI Calculation for Claims AI

### Cost per Claim Breakdown

| Process Step        | Traditional | AI-Enabled | Savings    |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| FNOL Intake         | $5          | $0.50      | $4.50      |
| Document Collection | $8          | $1.00      | $7.00      |
| Review/Adjudication | $15         | $2.00      | $13.00     |
| Payment Processing  | $3          | $0.50      | $2.50      |
| **Total**           | **$31**     | **$4.00**  | **$27.00** |

### Volume-Based ROI Example

```
Annual Claims: 1,000,000
AI Automation Rate: 60%
Cost Savings per AI Claim: $27

Annual Savings = 1M × 60% × $27 = $16.2M
Implementation Cost: $3M
First Year ROI: ($16.2M - $3M) / $3M = 440%
```
