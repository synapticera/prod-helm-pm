## Key Frameworks

### Market Sizing: The "So What"
- **Cloud transition baseline:** $400B in revenue - already bigger than the global software market when that transition began
- **AI opportunity:** At least an order of magnitude (10x) bigger than cloud
- **Critical insight:** AI is attacking BOTH services AND software profit pools simultaneously
  - Companies progress from selling tools → co-pilot → autopilot → selling outcomes
  - Moving from software budgets to labor budgets

### Why Now: Distribution Physics Have Changed
Three requirements for distribution:
1. People know about your thing
2. People want your thing
3. People can buy your thing

**Key differences vs. cloud era:**
- **Awareness:** ChatGPT launch (Nov 30, 2022) = instant global attention vs. Salesforce's guerrilla marketing needs
- **Discovery:** 1.2-1.8B people on Reddit/Twitter (didn't exist during cloud transition)
- **Access:** 5.6B people connected to internet (vs 200M during cloud era)
- **Result:** No barriers to adoption when starting gun went off

### The Layer Cake of Readiness
AI is imminent because all precedent conditions are in place:
- Compute ✓
- Networks ✓
- Data ✓
- Distribution ✓
- Talent ✓

Technology waves are additive - opportunity is bigger AND coming faster than prior waves.

## Where Value Will Accrue

### Application Layer Dominance
Most companies that reached $1B+ revenue in prior transitions were at the application layer. Same expected for AI.

**However:** New competitive dynamic with "second scaling law" (test-time compute) allowing foundation models to reach into application layer.

**Startup defense strategies:**
- Work from customer back (not tech out)
- Think vertical-specific
- Think function-specific
- Handle complex problems requiring human-in-the-loop

### The Leone Merchandising Cycle & Building Moats
Moats across the entire value chain:
- **Customer back:** Have opinion on what customers want, provide end-to-end solutions
- **Data flywheel:** Build with usage data of your own product (unique advantage)
- **Industry expertise:** "Of the industry, for the industry" (e.g., Harvey sends lawyers to law firms)
- **Deep integration:** "Put a big bear hug around your customers" in ways foundation models won't

## Key Metrics for AI Companies

### 1. Revenue: Real vs "Vibe Revenue"
- **Problem:** "Vibe revenue can kill you" - feels good but isn't real
- **Solution:** Inspect adoption, engagement, retention
- **Question:** Is it tire-kicking or durable behavior change?
- **Trust factor:** Customer trust is MORE important than your product at this point in the cycle
  - If customers trust you to improve, you're in good shape
  - If they don't trust you, you're in bad shape

### 2. Margins: Focus on Trajectory, Not Current State
- **COGS declining:** Cost per token down 99% in last 12-18 months
- **Price increasing:** As you move from selling tools → selling outcomes, capture more value
- **Conclusion:** Gross margins may not be great today, but should have clear path to healthy margins

### 3. Data Flywheel: Must Connect to Business Metrics
- **Critical test:** What business metric does your data flywheel move?
- **Reality check:** If you can't answer this, your data flywheel is BS or doesn't matter
- **Importance:** One of the best moats you can build

## State of AI in 2024-2025

### Customer Engagement: The Punchline Changed
- **2023:** AI apps had terrible daily/monthly active user ratios - "hype exceeded reality"
- **2024:** ChatGPT's engagement ratio now approaching Reddit levels
- **Meaning:** People are getting real value and weaving AI into daily lives

### Three Major Trends

#### 1. Voice AI: The "Her" Moment
- Voice generation crossed the uncanny valley in 2024
- Turing test "just snuck up on us"

#### 2. Coding: Screaming Product-Market Fit
- Breakout application category of the year
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet triggered "rapid vibe shift in coding landscape"
- Examples: People vibe-coding their own alternatives to complex tools
- **Impact:** Fundamentally changing accessibility, speed, and economics of software creation
- **Preview of abundance era:** First market category to tip

#### 3. AI Applications Emerging
First cohort of killer apps has emerged:
- ChatGPT, Harvey, Glean, Sierra, Cursor, Abridge, Listen Labs, Open Evidence

---

## Technology Breakthroughs

### Beyond Pre-training Scaling
Pre-training slowing down (scaled 9-10 orders of magnitude since AlexNet - low-hanging fruit picked)

**New breakthrough areas:**
- **Reasoning:** OpenAI's O1/O3 models with test-time compute
- **Synthetic data**
- **Tool use** and **agentic scaffolding**
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Creating ecosystem and network effects

### Blurry Boundary: Research ↔ Product
Most exciting innovation happening between research and product:
- Deep Research (OpenAI - Issa Hulford)
- Notebook LM (Risa and Jason, now creating "Hu")

## Agent Economy: The Next Wave

### From Agents → Agent Swarms → Agent Economy

**Evolution:**
1. **Agents (2024):** Machine assistants beginning to form into businesses
2. **Agent Swarms (Current):** Networks of agents collaborating, reasoning together
3. **Agent Economy (Future):** Agents don't just communicate information - they transfer resources, make transactions, track trust/reliability

**Key principle:** Agents work WITH people, people work WITH agents (not cutting humans out)

### Three Critical Technical Challenges

#### 1. Persistent Identity
Two types needed:
- **Agent persistence:** Agent's own personality and understanding must be consistent
  - If you do business with someone who changes daily, you won't trust them
- **User memory:** Agent must remember YOU
  - If they can't remember your name, trust breaks down
- **Current gaps:** RAG, vector DBs, long context windows exist, but true memory and self-learning still need work

#### 2. Seamless Communication Protocols
- Like imagining personal computing without TCP/IP
- MCP is promising start - big players collaborating
- Need protocols for: information transfer, value transfer, trust transfer

#### 3. Security & Trust
- Can't meet "palm to palm, face to face" with agents
- Entire cottage industry will form around agent trust and security
- Even MORE important than in current economy

### Agent Types Emerging

#### Vertical Agents (Specialist Approach)
- Trained end-to-end for specific workflows
- Using RL on synthetic data + user data
- **Early evidence of outperforming humans:**
  - **Expo:** Agent outperforms human penetration testers (security)
  - **Traversal:** AI troubleshooter beats best human troubleshooters (DevOps)
  - **Meter:** Outperforms networking engineers

#### Two Paths to Robustness
1. **Orchestration** with rigorous testing and evals
2. **Agents tuned** on end-to-end tasks

## The Abundance Era

### What Happens When Labor Becomes Cheap and Plentiful?
Coding offers preview:
- When abundance hits, what prevents AI slop?
- **Taste becomes the scarce asset**
- Harbinger for how other industries will transform

---

## Mindset Shifts Required

### 1. Stochastic Mindset
**Departure from determinism:**
- Traditional: Program computer → it does exactly that (even if segfault)
- AI era: Ask AI to remember "73" → might remember 73, 37, 72, 74, 79, or nothing
- **Impact:** Materially different thinking from decades past

### 2. Management Mindset
- Transition from IC engineer → engineering manager applied broadly
- Understanding what agents can/can't do
- More complex managerial decisions: blocking processes, giving feedback
- (Hopefully avoiding year-end reviews of agents)

### 3. More Leverage, Less Certainty
- Can do MORE
- Must manage uncertainty and risks
- Everyone in tech is well-suited to thrive in this world

---

## Vision: Networks of Neural Networks

**Progression:**
1. Individual functions have AI agents
2. Functions merge → entire processes completed by AI agents
3. Processes merge → neural networks within large complex neural networks

**Prediction:** First one-person unicorn hasn't happened yet, but companies scaling faster with fewer people than ever

**Ultimate impact:**
- Reinvent individual work
- Rewire companies
- Recreate the economy

---

## Key Imperatives for Founders

### 1. Go at Maximum Velocity ALL THE TIME
- "Nature hates a vacuum"
- Tremendous sucking sound in the market for AI
- Macroeconomic noise (tariffs, interest rates) doesn't matter
- Rising tide of tech adoption swamps market volatility
- **If you don't get in front of it, somebody else will**

### 2. Focus on Moats and Metrics
Despite velocity imperative, remember:
- Build real revenue, not vibe revenue
- Create clear path to healthy margins
- Ensure data flywheel moves actual business metrics

### 3. Win at the Application Layer
- Value will accrue here (despite foundation model competition)
- Go customer-back, not tech-out
- Vertical-specific and function-specific approaches
