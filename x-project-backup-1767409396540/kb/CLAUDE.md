# Helm Knowledge Base - Context for Claude

## Product Overview

### Product Name Evolution
- **Agentfinder** → **Miner** → **EVOLVE** → **Helm** (current)
- **EVOLVE** was the primary brand name immediately before Helm
- Most business plan documents use "EVOLVE" branding
- **Helm** represents a focused positioning on customer service executive command center

### Core Positioning - Helm (Current)

**Helm** is the AI command center for customer service executives - providing the context and strategic clarity they need to lead with confidence.

**Key Concept:** Fills the gap between operational tools and strategic decision-making. Not execution tools, but decision intelligence - the layer that shows executives what they can't see so they can act on what matters.

**One-liner:** "Helm is the AI command center that shows customer service leaders what they can't see — so they can act on what matters."

**Target Audience:** Customer service executives who have blind spots - either in execution or strategy

**Value Proposition:**
- Provides context across 5 dimensions: operational, financial, team, customer experience, strategic
- Executive co-pilot that gives "one view of what's happening and one clear answer: what to do next"
- Command layer that sits above CRM, ticketing, workforce management, analytics

### Core Positioning - EVOLVE (Platform Brand)

**EVOLVE** is positioned as "The Agent Assurance & ROI Platform" - the first platform to combine process mining, task mining, org mining, and agent observability.

**One-sentence pitch:** "EVOLVE is the first Agent Assurance & ROI platform that combines process mining, task mining, org mining, and agent observability to show companies exactly what to automate, prove the ROI, and continuously ensure AI agents are delivering value."

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Four Intelligence Layers** (unique integration):
  1. **Process Mining**: Workflow intelligence
  2. **Task Mining**: What people actually do (edge-first, privacy-preserving)
  3. **Org Mining**: System configuration & tech debt (Salesforce Org MRI - unique)
  4. **Agent Observability**: AI agent performance & ROI (AgentOps Flight Recorder)

**Go-to-Market Wedge:**
- Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs via AppExchange
- 44K-51K companies, $5.4B TAM
- Weak competition in this segment

**Unique Assets:**
- **EVOLVE Transformation Score**: "FICO score for agent readiness"
- **Salesforce Org MRI**: System health and tech debt analysis
- **AgentOps Flight Recorder**: Agent performance monitoring

## Product Architecture

- Network effects: more users → better benchmarks → smarter recommendations

## Category & Market Position

### Emerging Category: Decision Intelligence / Agent Assurance

**Category Names Being Considered:**
- **Agent Assurance & ROI** (current EVOLVE positioning)
- **Agent-Centric Operations (ACO)** - emphasizes agents as core focus
- **Operational Work Evolution (OWE)** - modern language, avoids BPM baggage
- **Continuous Work Evolution (CWE)** - signals ongoing adaptation

**Related Market Categories:**
- Context Graphs (Foundation Capital / Jaya Gupta)
- Decision Intelligence (Gartner, IDC)
- Execution Intelligence Layer (Ed Sim / Boldstart)
- Enterprise Context Management

**Core Thesis:**
- Traditional systems captured WHAT happened (Salesforce, Workday, SAP)
- New opportunity: capturing WHY it happened - decision traces, exceptions, approvals, precedents
- Context ≠ metadata or prompts - it's decision-time understanding: inputs, intent, constraints, history, permissions, exceptions, alternatives
- Startups in the "orchestration path" have structural advantage

**Key Thought Leaders:**
- Jaya Gupta & Ashu Garg (Foundation Capital) - "Context Graphs: AI's Trillion-Dollar Opportunity"
- Ed Sim (Boldstart Ventures) - "What's Hot in Enterprise IT/VC"
- Aaron Levie (Box) - "Jevon's Paradox for Knowledge Work"
- Mark Palmer - "Enterprise Context Management"

- AI Agents: $68B (35% CAGR)
- Process Mining: $23B (33% CAGR)
- RPA: $36B (27% CAGR)
- SAM: $31B (US/UK/EU, 100-10K employees)

**Labor Cost Savings TAM: $98.6B annually**
- 29M target knowledge workers
- $85K average fully-loaded cost
- 40% automation potential

**Target Segments:**
- **Primary:** 150,000 SMB companies (100-2,000 employees) - completely ignored by incumbents

- **Enterprise:** 8,000 large enterprises (upmarket move)

## Competitive Strategy

### Low-End Disruption Playbook

**Why We Win:**

| Dimension | Legacy Vendors | Helm/EVOLVE |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Product | Mining technology (expensive) | Mining is free, monetize transformation |
| Market | Enterprise-only (8,000 cos.) | SMB-first (150,000 cos.), then upmarket |
| Pricing | $100K-500K deals | Freemium → $500-50K/month |
| Distribution | Enterprise field sales | Product-led growth, viral adoption |
| Intelligence | Siloed per customer | Aggregate learning across users |
| Economics | High CAC, slow growth | Near-zero CAC, rapid scaling |
| Moat | Technology (commoditizing) | Network effects (compounding) |

**Competitive Moats:**
1. Technology: Edge-first LLM architecture

### Working with This Knowledge Base

**When positioning Helm:**
- Emphasize "executive co-pilot" and "command center" framing
- Focus on decision intelligence and context, not just data
- Highlight blind spots problem and strategic clarity solution
- Avoid "just another dashboard" or tool positioning

**When discussing technical architecture:**
- Edge-first, privacy-preserving is core differentiator
- Fleet learning / aggregate intelligence is the moat
- Smart retention strategy balances comprehensive capture with privacy

**When discussing business model:**
- Always lead with freemium and SMB-first disruption
- Network effects and peer benchmarking are unique advantages
- Low-end disruption playbook (Atlassian, Zoom, Figma parallels)

**When discussing category:**
- Reference Decision Intelligence / Context Graphs thought leadership
- Position as systems of record for decisions, not data
- Emphasize orchestration path structural advantage

## EVOLVE vs Helm: Understanding the Relationship

**EVOLVE** represents the full platform play:
- Broader market: all business process transformation
- Four intelligence layers: Process Mining + Task Mining + Org Mining + Agent Observability
- Salesforce AppExchange wedge strategy (Service Cloud SMBs)
- End-to-end platform from discovery to deployment to assurance
- Category: "Agent Assurance & ROI Platform"

**Helm** represents a focused vertical positioning:
- Narrower market: customer service executive command center
- Decision intelligence for customer service leaders
- "Executive co-pilot" framing
- Command layer that sits above operational tools
- Category: "Decision Intelligence" / "Context Intelligence"

**The Strategic Relationship:**
- Helm appears to be a vertical market entry strategy or rebrand
- EVOLVE = horizontal platform, Helm = vertical application
- Both leverage same technical foundation (task mining, fleet learning, edge-first architecture)
- Current business plan documents use EVOLVE branding and will need updating for Helm positioning

## Important Notes & Next Actions

**Product Name Evolution:**
- Agentfinder → Miner → **EVOLVE** → **Helm** (current)
- Be aware of which brand/positioning each document references
- **EVOLVE** was the immediate predecessor to Helm

**Business Plan Update Required:**
- Most recent documents in `/bplan-prior-version/` dated Jan 2, 2026
- **NEEDS UPDATE:** Investor deck, revenue model, expense model, investor brief
- Decision needed: Continue with EVOLVE platform positioning or pivot fully to Helm vertical positioning?

**Category Timing:**
- Decision Intelligence / Context Graphs category emerging NOW (late 2024/early 2025)
- Agent Assurance & ROI is EVOLVE's proposed new category
- Perfect timing for category creation/leadership

**Key Differentiators:**
- Peer benchmarking data that doesn't exist anywhere else
- Four-layer intelligence integration (unique to EVOLVE)
- Edge-first, privacy-preserving architecture
- Fleet learning / network effects
- Freemium SMB-first disruption model

**Competitive Urgency:**
- 12-month window before Salesforce potentially integrates Apromore (process mining vendor they might acquire)
- Traditional vendors trapped in enterprise-only economics
- SMB market (150,000 companies) completely unaddressed
