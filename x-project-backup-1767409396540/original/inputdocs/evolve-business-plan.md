## 1. Executive Summary

### Company Mission

EVOLVE democratizes business process transformation by making enterprise-grade process intelligence accessible to businesses of all sizes through edge AI, freemium economics, and network-powered peer benchmarking.

### The Opportunity

The business transformation market is broken. Traditional process mining vendors (Celonis at $13B, UiPath at $12B) sell expensive technology to 8,000 large enterprises at $100K-500K per deployment, leaving 150,000 SMB companies unable to afford transformation. Meanwhile, business leaders lack critical competitive intelligence about how their processes compare to peers.

**EVOLVE's Wedge: The Salesforce Ecosystem**

We enter through the **Salesforce Service Cloud install base**—90,000-105,000 customers with 1.2-1.5M customer service agents—using a Salesforce-native, SMB-first strategy that incumbents cannot match:

* **Captive audience**: 150,000+ companies already on Salesforce, 49% are SMBs
* **Built-in distribution**: AppExchange provides low-CAC customer acquisition
* **Simple economics**: $350-400 per service agent per month = instant value calculation
* **Deep expertise**: Existing Salesforce customer relationships and ecosystem knowledge
* **Speed advantage**: Salesforce acquired Apromore (process mining) - we have ~1 year to establish dominance before integration

EVOLVE disrupts using the Tesla playbook: commodity components (LLMs instead of LIDAR), edge-first architecture (privacy + cost efficiency), freemium distribution (viral adoption), and fleet learning (compounding network effects)—all deployed first in the Salesforce ecosystem where we have unfair advantages.

### The Solution

EVOLVE is the first end-to-end platform that discovers actual workflows, designs AI-powered transformation roadmaps, deploys autonomous agents, and ensures continuous improvement—all while building aggregate intelligence that provides unprecedented peer benchmarking insights.

### Market Size

**Salesforce Wedge (Primary Entry):**
* **Salesforce Service Cloud TAM**: $5.4B (90K customers, 1.2M agents @ $4,500/agent/year)
* **Salesforce SAM**: $1.08B (20K target customers in SMB/mid-market, North America, priority verticals)
* **5-Year Target from Salesforce**: $212M ARR (18% SAM penetration, 50,400 agents automated)

**Total Market Beyond Salesforce:**
* **Technology TAM**: $127B by 2030 (AI agents $68B + process mining $23B + RPA $36B)
* **Labor Savings TAM**: $98.6B annually (29M target workers × $3,400 revenue per worker)
* **Broader SAM**: $31B (US/UK/EU, 100-10K employees, all high-volume functions)

**Our Strategy:** Land in Salesforce SMB ($71M Year 3), expand in Salesforce enterprise, then expand to non-Salesforce platforms with proven model.

### Business Model

**Free Tier:** Full workflow discovery and process mining (build user base)  
**Paid Tier 1:** Transformation execution with AI agents ($500-$50K/month)  
**Paid Tier 2:** Enterprise platform with continuous improvement ($50K-$500K+/month)

**Unit Economics:** 80-400:1 LTV:CAC across segments, 80-85% gross margins, 130%+ NDR

### Competitive Advantage

1. **Salesforce Ecosystem Dominance**: Deep expertise, existing customer relationships, and Salesforce-native architecture that provides 10x faster deployment than external tools
2. **Speed to Market**: Salesforce acquired Apromore (process mining vendor) - we have ~12 months to establish market position before integration completes
3. **Independence Advantage**: Customers prefer independent solutions over Salesforce-owned tools for process intelligence—they want a separate layer, not platform vendor lock-in
4. **SMB-first low-end disruption** where incumbents can't compete economically
5. **Compounding network effects** through aggregate workflow intelligence and peer benchmarking that doesn't exist anywhere else

### Traction & Milestones

**18-Month Path to Series A:**
- Month 6: $250K MRR, 100 paying SMB customers
- Month 12: $1.5M MRR, 1,500 paying customers  
- Month 18: $6M ARR, 3,000+ customers, Series A ready

### The Ask

**$2-3M seed extension** for 18-month runway to achieve $6M+ ARR and position for strong Series A ($20-30M raise).

## 3. The Problem

### The Triple Crisis in Business Transformation

Companies face three interconnected failures when attempting process transformation:

#### 3.1 The Discovery Gap

**Problem:** 95% of AI agent initiatives fail because companies don't understand their actual processes well enough to know what to automate.

**Current Approaches Fail:**
- Manual process mapping is slow, expensive, and immediately outdated
- Process mining tools require expensive enterprise deployments ($100K-500K)
- Task mining needs specialized sensors and raises security concerns
- SMBs are completely priced out of discovery tools

**Impact:** Companies spend millions trying to understand their own operations before they can even begin transformation.

#### 3.2 The Execution Gap

**Problem:** Process mining vendors identify problems but provide no actionable path to transformation, leaving executives frozen between insight and action.

**Current Approaches Fail:**
- Mining tools generate static reports, not executable solutions
- RPA requires perfect process definitions upfront and breaks with any change
- Custom agent development takes months with no ROI guarantee  
- System integrations require expensive consultants

**Impact:** Companies pay for insights they can't act on, then pay again for implementation that may fail.

#### 3.3 The Assurance Gap

**Problem:** Even successful transformations decay over time because there's no system ensuring continuous improvement and learning.

**Current Approaches Fail:**
- One-time consulting engagements leave no ongoing monitoring
- Static automation breaks when processes change
- No learning loops or continuous optimization
- Each company solves the same problems in isolation

**Impact:** Transformation ROI erodes as processes drift and opportunities go unidentified.

### The Intelligence Gap: What Business Leaders Desperately Need

Beyond the execution challenges, business leaders are starving for competitive intelligence that simply doesn't exist:

**Critical Unanswered Questions:**
- "How do my peers in similar companies handle this process?"
- "Am I overstaffed or understaffed compared to industry norms?"
- "What's the best-practice workflow for this scenario?"
- "Where should I focus transformation efforts for maximum ROI?"

**Why This Matters:** Process mining vendors provide siloed analysis with generic industry benchmarks. No one offers specific, detailed insights mapped to actual workflows across real peer companies.

### Market Failure: The SMB Left Behind

**The Economics Don't Work:**
- Traditional vendors need $100K-500K deals to cover sales and implementation costs
- Enterprise field sales cost $50K+ per customer to acquire
- Cloud-based architectures create security concerns and high compute costs
- Complex integrations require consultant partners

**The Result:** 150,000 SMB companies (100-500 employees) are completely ignored by process mining vendors because the economics don't work. These companies desperately need transformation but can't access the tools or insights that would enable it.

### Total Addressable Pain

**For SMBs:**
- Can't afford $100K+ process mining tools
- Lack competitive intelligence about peer performance
- Need transformation to compete with larger players
- Flying blind on automation opportunities

**For Mid-Market:**
- Overpaying for enterprise tools designed for much larger organizations
- Slow deployment cycles (6-12 months)
- No aggregate learning or peer insights
- High CAC for modest improvements

**For Enterprises:**
- Paying premium prices for static analysis
- Siloed implementations with no cross-company learning
- Traditional vendors focused on mining, weak on execution
- No continuous improvement intelligence

**Market Consensus:** Every analyst report, every industry survey shows the same pattern—companies want transformation but current solutions are too expensive, too slow, and don't provide the peer insights necessary to make confident decisions.

- Customer lifetime: 4-5 years average

**Customer Economics:**
- LTV: $150,000-$400,000
- LTV:CAC ratio: 100-300:1
- Churn: 8-12% annually
- Net Dollar Retention: 130-150% (strong expansion as usage grows)

**Enterprise Segment (2,000-10,000 employees):**

**Customer Acquisition:**
- CAC: $2,000-5,000 (enterprise sales, but inbound-driven)
- Sales cycle: 3-6 months (faster than competition due to grassroots)
- Main channels: Freemium land, enterprise sales close
- Sales cost: Enterprise AE handling 15-25 customers

**Customer Value:**
- Average ARR: $200K (Year 1) → $500K+ (Year 3+) through expansion
- Gross margin: 80% (higher touch, custom requirements)
- Payback period: 3-6 months
- Customer lifetime: 5+ years average

**Customer Economics:**
- LTV: $500,000-$2,000,000+
- LTV:CAC ratio: 100-400:1
- Churn: 5-8% annually (lowest churn, highest retention)

#### 6.4 Why Our Economics Work

**1. Edge Architecture = Structural Cost Advantage**
- 70-80% lower compute costs vs. cloud-based competitors
- Users provide the compute power (their devices)
- Central infrastructure only for aggregation and intelligence
- Gross margins 10-15 points higher than competition

**2. Freemium = Near-Zero CAC for SMB**
- Product-led growth eliminates traditional sales costs
- Free tier creates viral adoption
- Automated onboarding and activation
- CAC 10-100x lower than enterprise sales model

**3. Network Effects = Compounding Value**
- Each user improves product for all users
- Benchmarking value increases with user base
- Switching costs increase over time
- Winner-takes-most dynamics

**4. Consumption-Based Expansion**
- Base subscription provides predictable revenue
- Token consumption grows with customer success
- Natural expansion as more workflows automated
- No sales effort required for expansion revenue

**5. Peer Benchmarking = Retention & Expansion**
- Customers can't get peer insights elsewhere
- Comparative dashboards create daily engagement
- "How am I doing vs. peers?" creates stickiness
- More users = more valuable benchmarks = higher retention

#### 6.5 Revenue Model Validation

**Comparable SaaS Companies:**

**Freemium B2B SaaS (Our Model):**
- Slack: 30-40% free-to-paid conversion, 120-140% NDR
- Zoom: 30%+ free-to-paid conversion, 130%+ NDR
- Dropbox: 3-4% free-to-paid conversion (less viral), 110-120% NDR
- **Our Target: 30-40% SMB, 25-30% mid-market conversion, 130%+ blended NDR**

**Network Effect Platforms:**
- Figma: Strong network effects, 150%+ NDR, premium multiples
- Snowflake: Data network effects, 168% NDR, 40x+ revenue multiple
- **Our Target: 130-150% NDR driven by benchmarking network effects**

**Process Mining (Traditional):**
- Celonis: Enterprise-only, estimated 110-120% NDR, high CAC
- UiPath: Broader automation, 120-130% NDR, still high CAC
- **Our Advantage: 10-100x lower CAC, comparable or better NDR**

**Validation:** Our unit economics are aggressive but grounded in proven freemium B2B and network effect SaaS benchmarks. The key differentiator is SMB volume enabling category-leading CAC efficiency.

## 7. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Strategic Approach: Salesforce-Native SMB-First Disruption

We're executing a **three-phase land-and-expand strategy**:
1. **Land**: Salesforce Service Cloud SMB customers (Year 1-2)
2. **Expand in Salesforce**: Enterprise Service Cloud + Sales Cloud customers (Year 2-3)
3. **Expand beyond Salesforce**: Other platforms and standalone deployment (Year 3+)

This Salesforce-first approach gives us unfair advantages incumbents cannot match while building the network effects and proof points to dominate the broader market.

#### 7.1 Why Salesforce First

**Massive Captive Audience:**
- 150,000+ Salesforce customers, 90,000-105,000 use Service Cloud
- 1.2-1.5M customer service agents globally
- 49% are SMBs—our sweet spot
- Already paying Salesforce $25-165/user/month, understand SaaS value

**Built-In Distribution (AppExchange):**
- Salesforce AppExchange provides instant credibility and discovery
- 7,000+ apps, but no Service Cloud process intelligence + automation for SMBs
- Low-CAC customer acquisition ($200-500 vs. $5,000+ for traditional B2B)
- Freemium listing drives viral adoption within Salesforce community

**Salesforce-Native = 10x Advantage:**
- <1 day deployment vs. weeks/months for external tools
- No IT approval barriers (Salesforce customers trust native apps)
- Direct access to Service Cloud case data (no ETL complexity)
- Seamless UX within Salesforce platform

**Simple Per-Agent Economics:**
- **$350-400 per service agent per month**
- Instant opportunity calculation: "How many agents?" = Revenue
- Value proposition: Save $2,400/agent/month, pay us $375/month = 544% ROI
- Salesforce customers already understand per-user pricing

**Deep Competitive Moat:**
- **Our advantage**: Existing Salesforce customer relationships and ecosystem expertise
- **Timing advantage**: Salesforce acquired Apromore - we have ~12 months before integration
- **Independence advantage**: Customers prefer independent layer vs. Salesforce-owned solution
- **No competition**: No Salesforce-native Service Cloud process mining + automation for SMBs exists

**Proof Point for Expansion:**
- Validate model in defined, measurable market (Salesforce Service Cloud)
- Build network effects within Salesforce community first
- Use Salesforce success to expand to Sales Cloud, then Marketing Cloud
- Then take proven model beyond Salesforce to other platforms

#### 7.2 Why SMB First (Within Salesforce)

**Market Structure (Salesforce Service Cloud):**
- 44,000-51,000 SMB Salesforce Service Cloud customers (<100 employees)
- vs. 36,000-42,000 mid-market and 10,000-11,500 enterprises
- **Within Salesforce, SMBs represent 49% of customers but are completely underserved**

**Competitive Vacuum:**
- Traditional vendors require $100K+ deals to cover costs
- Enterprise field sales model costs $50K+ per customer
- SMB economics don't work for legacy vendors
- **We can own this segment with no competition**

**Adoption Velocity:**
- Faster buying cycles (weeks vs. months/years)
- Lower compliance requirements
- Decision makers fewer (often single buyer)
- Higher volume = faster learning

**Network Effects Acceleration:**
- More users faster = better aggregate intelligence faster
- SMB leaders talk to each other (tight peer networks)
- Peer benchmarking most valuable in underserved segments
- Viral coefficient higher in SMB communities

**Upmarket Path:**
- Prove model in volume segment
- Build overwhelming network effect advantages
- Mid-market sees SMB competitors improving
- Enterprise faces "why not us?" pressure from board
- Move upmarket with proof points and peer intelligence no one else has

- Peer intelligence across industries
- Broader transformation vision

#### 8.4 Salesforce/Apromore (Platform Vendor Threat)

**Salesforce + Apromore Acquisition**
- **Acquisition:** Salesforce acquired Apromore (process mining vendor) in 2024
- **Integration Timeline:** ~12 months until Salesforce-native Apromore offering
- **Threat Level:** High if we don't move fast; Moderate if we establish position

**Strengths:**
- Salesforce platform integration (native to 150,000+ customers)
- Salesforce brand and distribution power
- AppExchange presence and sales force
- Enterprise customer relationships
- Marketing budget and ecosystem influence

**Weaknesses:**
- **Integration complexity:** Takes 12-24 months to fully integrate acquisitions
- **Platform vendor bias:** Customers prefer independent solutions for process intelligence
- **Enterprise focus:** Salesforce will likely focus on large customers first (most revenue)
- **Apromore's legacy:** Enterprise-only product, no SMB strategy or economics
- **No network effects:** Salesforce won't build aggregate cross-customer intelligence (competitive reasons)
- **Pricing:** Will likely maintain enterprise pricing model ($100K+)

**Why We Win:**
- **Speed advantage:** We have 12 months to dominate SMB before they're ready
- **Independence positioning:** "We're the independent layer, not Salesforce-owned"
- **SMB focus:** We can own 44,000-51,000 SMB Service Cloud customers they'll ignore
- **Network effects:** Our cross-customer benchmarking creates defensible moat Salesforce won't replicate
- **Per-agent economics:** Our $350-400/agent/month model works for SMB; their enterprise pricing doesn't
- **Customer preference:** Enterprises want independent process intelligence layer, not platform vendor lock-in

**Our Strategy to Outflank Salesforce:**
1. **Move fast**: Launch on AppExchange Q4 2025, before Apromore integration
2. **SMB land grab**: Dominate 10,000+ SMB installs before Salesforce targets that segment
3. **Build network effects**: Create cross-customer intelligence Salesforce can't/won't build
4. **Independence messaging**: Position as "Salesforce-native but independently-owned"
5. **Lock-in through value**: High NDR through continuous improvement makes switching costly
6. **Potential acquisition**: If we execute well, Salesforce may acquire us instead of competing

**Key Insight:** Customers don't want Salesforce owning their process intelligence layer the same way they don't want AWS owning their observability tools (Datadog) or Microsoft owning their collaboration tools (Slack). Independence is a feature, not a bug.

#### 8.5 Management Consulting

**McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Accenture**

**Strengths:**
- Deep industry expertise
- Strategic advisory capabilities
- Enterprise relationships
- Large delivery organizations

**Weaknesses:**
- Human-delivered (not scalable)
- Extremely expensive (enterprise-only)
- No network effects or learning loops
- Deliver PowerPoint, not executable solutions
- No ongoing continuous improvement

**Why We Win:**
- Software platform (scalable)
- 1/100th the cost
- SMB to enterprise (accessible to all)
- Continuous improvement built in
- Network effects create compounding value

#### 8.6 Why No Competitor Can Replicate Our Approach

**Economic Impossibility for Legacy Vendors:**
- Their business models require $100K-500K average deals
- Field sales teams cost $50K+ per customer acquisition
- Implementation services are revenue centers
- **Can't serve SMB without destroying existing revenue**
- Would need to completely rebuild go-to-market and pricing

**Network Effects Moat:**
- First mover building SMB user base (150,000 companies)
- Each workflow captured strengthens our intelligence
- Peer benchmarking requires massive multi-company data set
- **By the time competitors try, insurmountable lead in aggregate intelligence**

**Architectural Lock-In:**
- Competitors built on cloud-based architectures
- Security concerns and compute costs baked in
- Can't retrofit edge-first approach
- **Would require complete platform rebuild**

**Business Model Innovation:**
- We give away what they sell (process mining)
- We monetize what they don't (transformation execution + value)
- **Structural advantage they can't copy without destroying current business**

**The Timeline of Disruption:**

**Year 1 (Now):**
- EVOLVE: 50K users, $1-2M ARR, SMB proof
- Competitors: Unaware or dismissive ("SMB isn't our market")

**Year 2:**
- EVOLVE: 200K users, $5-10M ARR, mid-market traction, peer benchmarking = killer differentiator
- Competitors: Recognize threat, attempt SMB plays (fail due to cost structure)

**Year 3:**
- EVOLVE: 500K+ users, $20-40M ARR, enterprise wins, category leader
- Competitors: Attempt network strategies (too late, can't change business model)

**Year 4-5:**

- CAC: $3,000 (enterprise sales, but inbound)
- Gross Margin: 81% (higher touch, custom needs)
- LTV: $500,000 (5-year average lifetime)
- LTV:CAC: 167:1
- Payback: 3-4 months

### Financial Assumptions & Sensitivities

**Key Assumptions:**
1. **Free-to-Paid Conversion:** 30-40% SMB, 25-30% mid-market, 15-20% enterprise (12-month window)
2. **Expansion Revenue:** 10-20% SMB, 30-50% mid-market, 40-80% enterprise (annual)
3. **Churn Rates:** 15-20% SMB, 8-12% mid-market, 5-8% enterprise
4. **Gross Margins:** 80-85% across segments (edge compute advantage)
5. **CAC Efficiency:** Improves 15-20% annually due to network effects and brand
6. **Sales Efficiency (Magic Number):** 1.1 → 2.0 over 5 years

**Sensitivities:**
- **10% lower conversion rates → Year 5 ARR: $270M** (still strong Series A and path to profitability)
- **20% higher churn → Year 5 ARR: $240M** (requires stronger expansion focus)
- **50% higher CAC → Year 5 EBITDA margin: 42%** (still healthy, but slower path to profitability)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Conservative projections assume 30-40% free-to-paid (vs. Slack's 30-40%, Zoom's 30%+)
- Churn assumptions higher than typical network effect SaaS (Figma <5%, Snowflake <5%)
- Blended CAC conservative vs. pure product-led growth companies (Calendly <$100)

## 13. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies

#### 13.1 Market Adoption Risk

**Risk:** SMBs may not adopt self-service process mining tools at projected rates

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Design partners (50 SMBs) validate product-market fit before scale
- Freemium eliminates adoption friction (no purchase decision required)
- Focus on highest-ROI segments first (Sales Ops, Support, Finance)
- Extensive user research and iterative product development
- Conservative conversion rate assumptions (30-40% vs. potential 40-50%)

**Early Warning Signals:**
- Free user activation rates below 60%
- Time-to-first-value exceeding 2 weeks
- Free-to-paid conversion below 20% at 12 months
- User retention below 70% at 90 days

#### 13.2 Competitive Response Risk

**Risk:** Incumbent vendors (Celonis, UiPath) pivot to SMB or launch freemium

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Incumbents face innovator's dilemma (SMB threatens core business)
- Their cost structures don't support SMB economics
- We build network effects moat before they can respond
- Our edge architecture is fundamental advantage they can't copy quickly
- SMB-first go-to-market is 2-3 years ahead by the time they react

**Competitive Monitoring:**
- Track incumbent product announcements and pricing changes
- Monitor customer win/loss reasons
- Maintain 2x faster product velocity
- Build switching costs through aggregate intelligence

#### 13.3 Technical Execution Risk

**Risk:** Edge-first LLM architecture doesn't perform well enough or is too complex

- Month 12: Users sharing benchmarks with colleagues (viral loop visible)
- Month 18: Benchmarking is #1 cited reason for choosing EVOLVE

#### 13.6 Unit Economics Risk

**Risk:** Customer acquisition costs are higher or LTV lower than projected

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Freemium inherently lowers CAC vs. enterprise sales
- Conservative LTV:CAC assumptions (100:1 vs. potential 200-400:1)
- Multiple levers to improve economics (conversion rates, expansion, retention)
- Adjust pricing and packaging based on early data
- Strong gross margins (80-85%) provide buffer

**Monitoring:**
- Track CAC by channel and segment monthly
- Monitor conversion rates and payback periods
- Adjust go-to-market spend based on ROI
- Pivot to profitable segments if economics don't work in certain areas

#### 13.7 Churn Risk

**Risk:** Customers churn faster than projected, reducing LTV

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Network effects create switching costs (lose peer benchmarks)
- Continuous improvement maintains value over time
- Strong customer success focus on activation and adoption
- Usage-based pricing aligns with customer value
- Conservative churn assumptions (15-20% SMB vs. industry 10-15%)

**Retention Initiatives:**
- Automated health scoring and proactive outreach
- Regular value realization reviews
- Community and peer learning programs
- Feature adoption campaigns
- Early warning system for at-risk customers

#### 13.8 Funding Risk

**Risk:** Unable to raise Series A at desired valuation or terms

**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Clear 18-month milestones to Series A metrics
- Multiple funding options (Series A, strategic investors, alternative lenders)
- Efficient burn rate and path to profitability visible
- Strong unit economics and growth metrics attractive to investors
- Build relationships with Series A investors early

**Funding Plan B:**
- Extend runway through revenue growth (aim for break-even by Month 24)
- Bridge financing from existing investors
- Strategic investment from category adjacencies (Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.)

#### 13.9 Team Risk

**Risk:** Unable to attract or retain top talent

**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Competitive compensation and meaningful equity
- Mission-driven opportunity (democratizing transformation)
- Remote-first flexibility
- Strong technical and product challenges (edge AI, aggregate intelligence)
- Founder track record and advisor network

**Retention Strategies:**
- Regular check-ins and feedback
- Career development paths
- Equity refreshers for high performers
- Strong culture and values
- Transparent communication

#### 13.10 Regulatory Risk

**Risk:** Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) create barriers or compliance costs

**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Edge-first architecture is GDPR/CCPA compliant by design
- Privacy-preserving aggregate intelligence (anonymous patterns only)
- Legal counsel with data privacy expertise
- Proactive compliance vs. reactive
- Competitive advantage: edge architecture avoids many cloud compliance issues

**Regulatory Monitoring:**
- Track regulatory changes in target markets
- Participate in industry associations and policy discussions
- Build compliance into product from day one
- Regular legal reviews
