# Call Summary: Mindsey Collaboration Discussion

**Date:** 2025-11-28  
**Participants:** Soren Frederiksen (Mindsey), Bill Karpovich (Bill's Company)

---

## Key Points

### Bill's Company Overview
- Building a next-generation task and process mining platform targeting the US market
- Focus on secure, non-intrusive process understanding linked to AI-based solutions
- Early-stage product with current customer deployments
- Seeking strong technology leaders to help bring product to market
- Positioned to address agentic transformation and AI-driven process optimization

### Mindsey Company Overview
- **Founded:** 5 years ago (started before major market acquisitions by Microsoft/Celonis)
- **Team:** Founder Soren + Partner James Henderson (2.5 people total)
- **Tech Stack:** Full modern platform built in .NET with Blazer web technology
- **Key Differentiators:**
  - No-code platform with Python integration capability
  - On-premise AND cloud hosting (unlike most competitors)
  - Multi-tenant architecture with healthcare compliance
  - Can deploy on Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, or Alibaba
  - AI-integrated development and deployment processes

### Process Mining Market Insights
- **US Market Challenge:** 6-12 month sales cycles; "process mining" terminology creates confusion
- **Geographic Distribution:** Strong in Europe, Turkey, Australia; weak in North America (only 2 Canadian + 2 US customers)
- **Market Dynamics:**
  - Celonis over-promised and overcharged; created burned customers
  - Salesforce acquired Appromote (academic/research-focused approach)
  - Mindsey sees opportunity in business-focused (vs. academic) approach
  - US companies more top-down; European companies more open to bottom-up tech adoption

### Task Mining vs. Process Mining
Soren's Position (informed by 5 years experience):
- **Task mining challenges:** Privacy concerns, lengthy installation, high cost-to-value ratio
- **Task mining use case:** Only valuable for non-ERP system steps (e.g., manual steps between SAP transactions)
- **Real insight:** 95% of customers don't need complex algorithms; basic process mining solves their problems
- **Mindsey approach:** Rarely uses task mining; focuses on process mining for cost/privacy reasons

### Data Integration Strategy
- **Mindsey's approach:** Connect directly to source systems (20+ database types), not through centralized data warehouse
- **Key differentiator:** Read-only database connections to SAP, Oracle, etc.
- **Advantage over Celonis:** Avoids forcing customers to use third-party data warehouse; reduces privacy exposure
- **Reality of implementations:** 60-80% of project time spent on data transformation/extraction
- **Data strategy gap:** Many large US companies lack data strategies; siloed databases are common

### Platform Capabilities
- **Process Intelligence Focus:** Sells outcomes, not process maps
- **Deployment Model:**
  - Reports sent to customers (low-touch analytics)
  - Custom branding available
  - Healthcare-optimized (patient flow analysis)
  - Minimal vendor lock-in

### Healthcare Experience
- **Current Deployments:** 
  - Motorola (initial customer)
  - Ottawa Hospital (cancer ward; 6 months for approvals)
  - Hospital in Australia (via Hitachi partnership)
  - Saudi Arabia client (using Epic ERP)
- **Challenge:** Healthcare procurement extremely slow (~6 months for approvals)
- **Market opportunity:** IBM on-premise is only remaining major competitor; Appromote no longer viable

## Important Takeaways

1. **Market Opportunity Alignment:** Mindsey's frustration with US market adoption mirrors Bill's vision for a different go-to-market approach focused on outcomes vs. vendor features

2. **Complementary Positioning:** 
   - Mindsey = specialized process mining technology (strong backend, healthcare-proven)
   - Bill's Company = go-to-market platform targeting Salesforce customers + agentic AI transformation

3. **AI-Centric Partnership:** Both companies heavily AI-focused (Claude Code, AI agents in development) — strong cultural/technical alignment

4. **Healthcare Vertical Strength:** Mindsey's on-premise capability + healthcare compliance + patient flow expertise addresses Bill's healthcare vertical well

5. **Data Integration is 80% of the Work:** Both teams recognize that getting access to clean, integrated data is the real bottleneck — not the analytics algorithms

6. **Realistic Assessment:** Soren's honest perspective on task mining limitations, market challenges, and small-team reality suggests mature, pragmatic partnership potential (not hype-driven)

7. **Consulting Opportunity:** Soren open to consulting/knowledge-sharing while maintaining commitment to Mindsey partnership with James Henderson

8. **No Vendor Lock-in:** Mindsey's architecture (direct database connections, no proprietary data warehouse, cloud-agnostic hosting) appeals to enterprise security/compliance requirements
