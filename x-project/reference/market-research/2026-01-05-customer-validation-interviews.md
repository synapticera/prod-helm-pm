## The Customer Interviews

### Customer 1: Mike (VP Service, Large Enterprise)

**Situation**: 1,000+ customer service agents deployed, AI agent pilots in progress

**Quote**: "Our agents are breaking things we don't understand. We need someone to help us see what's happening and course-correct."

**What He's Saying**:

- Agents are making decisions autonomously
- Teams have no visibility into agent reasoning
- Can't course-correct when agents make mistakes
- **Need**: Decision visibility, governance, ability to understand and adjust agent behavior

**Relevance**: Validates core problem—agents lack management infrastructure

---

### Customer 2: Shibohn (Director of AI, Enterprise Retail)

**Situation**: Built a customer service agent last quarter; team adoption is blocked

**Quote**: "We built an agent last quarter. Nobody wants to use it because the team doesn't trust it. We need transparency and buy-in."

**What She's Saying**:

- Agent works technically
- Team rejection due to lack of trust
- Root cause: No transparency into agent decisions
- Team can't understand why agent made certain choices
- **Need**: Decision transparency, team buy-in, governance

**Relevance**: Validates trust gap—governance unlocks adoption

### Customer 3: Colby (Chief Service Officer, Financial Services)

**Situation**: 33% of AI pilots failed in his organization

**Quote**: "33% of our AI pilots failed. Not because the AI wasn't smart. Because we didn't have a clear governance model and the team rejected it."

**What He's Saying**:

- AI technology isn't the blocker
- Governance model failure caused rejection
- Team pushback on unmanaged agent autonomy
- **Need**: Governance framework, decision policies, team alignment

**Relevance**: Validates governance gap—management infrastructure is make-or-break

---

### Customer 4: Mark (VP Customer Operations, SaaS)

**Situation**: Service leader with decision data but no tools to leverage it

**Quote**: "I have decision traces in my logs but no way to learn from them. That's our competitive advantage we're leaving on the table."

**What He's Saying**:

- Raw decision data exists (traces in logs)
- No infrastructure to aggregate, analyze, learn
- Understands potential (competitive advantage)
- **Need**: Decision intelligence infrastructure to monetize decision data

**Relevance**: Validates opportunity—organizations have untapped decision assets

## Consistent Themes Across Interviews

| Theme              | Customer Evidence                           | What It Means                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Visibility Gap** | Mike: "breaking things we don't understand" | Agents lack management layer   |
| **Trust Gap**      | Shibohn: "team doesn't trust it"            | Transparency unlocks adoption  |
| **Governance Gap** | Colby: "no clear governance model"          | Governance is make-or-break    |
| **Data Asset Gap** | Mark: "decision traces we can't learn from" | Untapped competitive advantage |

## Key Finding: Urgency Is Real

### Why These Aren't "Nice-to-Have" Problems

1. **Shibohn's Agent Is Blocked**: Team rejection = project failure (immediate pain)
2. **Colby Lost 33% of Pilots**: Failed investments = CFO visibility (urgent priority)
3. **Mike's Agents Breaking Things**: Escalating risk = compliance concern (urgent)
4. **Mark's Competitive Advantage Wasted**: Lost revenue = board-level concern (strategic)

**Bottom Line**: These aren't future problems or optional improvements. Customers are **actively looking right now** for solutions.

| **Governance Framework** (Colby) | Design + Manage | Policy-based governance with audit trails        |
| **Decision Learning** (Mark)     | Design + Manage | Codified decision rules + continuous improvement |

## How to Use This in Messaging

### Investor Pitch

"We don't have to convince anyone this problem is real. Our customers are telling us they're actively looking for solutions right now."

### Sales Pitch

"These conversations represent 50+ customers with the same problem. We're not creating a market; we're solving an urgent gap in a market that already knows it needs this."

### Product Roadmap

"Every feature we build maps directly to customer feedback. Visibility, governance, learning—these are what our customers need, and we're building exactly that."

### Market Validation

"When service leaders across different industries independently identify the same problem—decision visibility, governance, trust—you know the market need is real."
