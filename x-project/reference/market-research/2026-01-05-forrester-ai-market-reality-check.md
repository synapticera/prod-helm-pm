## Key Statistics

- **Hype period ending; pragmatism replacing enthusiasm** - Market maturation happening now

## Market Implications

### The ROI Crisis

Companies are realizing that 95% of AI pilots fail to deliver value. When CFOs ask "where's the ROI?", teams don't have answers because they:

- Lack baseline understanding of current operations
- Can't measure what changed before/after agent deployment
- Have no governance framework to control deployment

### Spending Deferral Urgency

25% deferral to 2027 means companies are:

1. Pausing new AI projects
2. Focusing on fixing failed deployments
3. **Urgently seeking solutions to improve ROI on existing agents**

This creates immediate market demand for governance + decision intelligence infrastructure.

### Vertical Specialization Shift

$20B opportunity moving to specialized providers (neoclouds) rather than horizontal platforms. This validates Helm's vertical-specialist positioning.

## How to Use This in Messaging

### Investor Pitch

"25% of planned AI spending will defer to 2027 because companies can't prove ROI. This creates urgent demand for infrastructure that helps them extract value from existing agents."

### Service Leader Pitch

"You can't capture ROI without understanding your current operations first. Mine establishes that baseline so you know exactly what changed when agents deploy."

### Competitive Positioning

"Unlike horizontal AI platforms, we're vertical specialists focused on the segment with highest ROI and most acute governance need—customer service."
