### Main Theme: AI's Reality Check

Forrester projects a significant market correction in artificial intelligence adoption. The core issue: enterprises struggle to connect AI investments with financial growth, with fewer than one-third of decision-makers able to demonstrate measurable ROI.

### Critical Statistics

- **25% of planned AI spending will defer to 2027** as financial scrutiny intensifies and CFOs demand concrete ROI justification
- Fewer than one-third of decision-makers can "tie the value of AI to their organization's financial growth"
- **$20 billion revenue opportunity** emerging in specialized cloud providers (neoclouds) focusing on GPU-intensive AI workloads
- **Quantum security spending exceeds 5%** of total IT security budgets by 2026

### Key Predictions

**AI Market Shift:** The hype period concludes as expectations realign with actual deliverables. Production deployments slow while proof-of-concept initiatives face elimination.

**Talent Challenges:** Time to fill senior developer positions doubles as organizations integrate human expertise with AI capabilities, requiring strong system architecture foundations.

**Cloud Transformation:** Neoclouds gain traction by expanding orchestration capabilities, supporting open-source models, and offering sovereign AI solutions—eroding hyperscaler dominance.

**Security Priority:** Quantum security migrations accelerate through consulting services and cryptographic inventory tools.

### Expert Perspective

Forrester's Chief Research Officer noted: "the AI hype period ends as the pressure to deliver real, measurable results from secure AI initiatives intensifies."

The overarching message: pragmatism replaces enthusiasm in 2026.
