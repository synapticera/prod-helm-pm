#### A Fundamental Shift in Post-Sales

Customer Success is at a crossroads. Over the past decade, CS has been defined largely as a function focused on relationship management, product adoption, and health. This traditional model centered on assigning a human as a primary point of contact and guiding the customer through onboarding, adoption, and renewal. But in the age of AI and widespread budget consolidation, this model is no longer sufficient.

In 2024 alone, there was a 25% cost reduction in new CS job listings, and more than 60% of CS teams are now reporting flat or declining budgets. But expectations for growth are rising, with boards and C-suite executives demanding measurable revenue impact from post-Sales functions. At the same time, customer acquisition is harder, churn is at record highs, and expansion motions remain under-realized. In short, post-Sales is more important than ever. 

With the traditional GTM motions in disarray due to the noise caused by AI and outbound automation systems, post-Sales has the opportunity to evolve into the primary growth engine within a company. But post-Sales teams need a new paradigm for driving this customer-led growth motion, and a new north star around which to align their teams and operationalize their efforts. 

We call that new paradigm Customer-Led Growth through Value Realization.

#### From Relationships to Value 

The original promise of Customer Success was a compelling one. A strategic partner, assigned to a customer, focused on deeply understanding their business, using that knowledge and expertise to guide them in their efforts, and by doing so, protect existing revenue. It is still highly compelling today. But the weakness with the traditional approach to Customer Success was that it largely failed to operationalize teams around the number one factor that determines if a customer will continue to be a customer: whether or not that customer believes they received **value.**

What matters now, when markets get tough, budgets get tight, and scrutiny abounds, is whether or not an investment in a product or service has proven to drive meaningful, measurable business outcomes. Not adoption. Not activities. **Value**. Value that is defined in partnership with the customer, used as a north star for driving focus and accountability, rigorously measured over time, and considered the ultimate indicator of a customerâ€™s qualification for expansion.

To that end, teams need a new post-Sales paradigm â€“ one focused on aligning teams around driving measurable customer outcomes, and leveraging that proof of ROI to build a repeatable, predictable customer growth engine at scale. 

Totangoâ€™s Customer Growth Platform is designed to do just that, combining scalable customer management, predictive revenue intelligence, and a strategic, value-based post-Sales methodology to transform how companies prove customer ROI, drive retention, and earn expansion.

#### The Customer-Led Growth Methodology

Totango has codified this shift from traditional Customer Success (CS) to Customer-Led Growth (CLG) through its value realization methodology and software platform, purpose-built to help teams operationalize this new post-Sales strategy. The CLG methodology operationalizes how teams align around desired customer outcomes, activate customers on the most direct path to their desired value, measure and communicate proof of value to customer stakeholders, and finally leverage that proof of value to identify new value opportunities for expansion.

1. ***\*Align:\**** Define customer outcomes through Value-Level Agreements (VLAs) that establish accountability between vendor and customer from the start.
2. ***\*Activate:\**** Enable the minimum viable path to realizing value with templates, automation, and guided workflows.
3. ***\*Prove Value:\**** Track and surface objective progress through dashboards, reporting, and collaborative customer portals.
4. ***\*Grow:\**** Earn the right to expand by proving value delivered, nurturing new opportunities, and forecasting revenue with precision.

This methodology shifts CS from tracking activity to proving results. It establishes measurable value as the new post-Sales north star.

#### Why Value Matters Now More Than Ever

The timing for this shift in CS is urgent. 

Forresterâ€™s latest analysis, The Forrester Waveâ„¢: Customer Success Platforms, Q4 2025, underscores that CS is â€œentering a new era, one defined by a charter that emphasizes strategic clarity and commercial accountability.â€

Technology providers must enable teams not just to manage customer relationships, but to deliver measurable value, drive post-sale revenue growth, and use AI as a force multiplier for their teams, unlocking individual contributorsâ€™ abilities to focus on value and growth. 

AI is a central driver of this transition, moving CS teams from manual execution to intelligent, outcome-driven operations. From automating workflows to forecasting renewals and surfacing next best actions, AI frees teams to focus on high-impact work while driving consistency at scale.

#### Totango: A Leader, Charting a New Course for Customer-Led Growth

Totango has emerged as a Leader in The Forrester Waveâ„¢: Customer Success Platforms, Q4 2025.

### Summary

In our evaluation of customer success platform providers, we identified the most significant ones and researched, analyzed, and scored them. This report shows how each provider measures up and helps you select the right one for your needs.

### A New Charter Demands New Tools For Next-Generation Customer Success

Customer success (CS) is entering a new era, one defined by a charter that emphasizes strategic clarity and commercial accountability. To meet the moment, vendors are building platforms that reflect this shift, positioning CS not solely as a retention function, but as a driver of measurable customer value, revenue growth, and operational scale. AI is central to this transformation, with the technology embedded throughout the platforms to automate workflows, surface critical insights, and guide action across the postsale lifecycle. Vendors are also increasing investments in AI agents, predictive analytics, and orchestration tools that help CS teams move from manual execution to intelligent, impactful operations. At the same time, vendors are expanding their scope to enable more robust revenue forecasting, postsale success planning, and cross-functional collaboration. The market is moving away from siloed teams and tools and toward unified customer platforms that support multiple functions and deliver business outcomes for the customer and the company.

Customer success platform (CSP) customers using this evaluation to inform a purchase decision should consider providers that:

- **Help CS teams prove value, not just activity.** Modern solutions help CS teams define, deliver, and measure customersâ€™ progress toward outcomes. Advanced CSPs include improved collaborative success planning capabilities orchestrated through dedicated customer portals or shared links, and outcomes tracking that ties CS work directly to business results. This allows CS leaders to demonstrate impact in terms executives care about, such as retention and expansion revenue. Vendors are also investing in reporting and data visibility features that enable users to communicate progress across teams and facilitate cross-functional collaboration.
- **Support cross-functional collaboration across the postsale lifecycle.** CSPs unify data, workflows, and engagement across CS, sales, and support teams. Vendors are investing in collaborative planning tools such as shared tasks and embedded widgets in the CRM system for multiple roles and functions. These capabilities help organizations break down silos and align postsale teams around customer outcomes. Top vendors offer features that allow CS teams to surface expansion opportunities, share renewal insights, and coordinate customer onboarding across departments.
- **Leverage AI to drive intelligent scale and operational rigor.** AI has become foundational to how CSPs deliver value. Vendors are embedding AI within the platform to support task automation and insight generation and help guide strategic decisions. Many have also deployed AI agents, with more development on their roadmaps, to help CS teams forecast renewals and increase adoption with greater precision. These capabilities reduce manual effort and allow customer success managers (CSMs) to focus on high-impact work. Some vendors also offer AI-powered assistants and copilots that support CSMs in real time, improving productivity and consistency of work output.

#### Gainsight

Gainsight is a privately held company backed by Vista Equity Partners. It offers a broad suite of CS, product experience, and community engagement solutions, and it recently expanded its portfolio through the acquisitions of Staircase AI, Skilljar, and UpdateAI.

- **Strategy.** Gainsightâ€™s vision is focused on creating a unified system to enable postsale teams to scale, supported by AI agents that evolve into autonomous, strategic contributors. Innovation is superior, led by its Atlas AI agents to support renewals, adoption, and community moderation, plus expanded intelligence to surface risk. The roadmap is on par relative to other vendors in this evaluation, including enhancements to existing features, such as its customer portal and AI efficiency capabilities. Gainsight offers basic and premium pricing options but provides limited cost transparency.

- **Capabilities.** Gainsight earned high marks for expansion opportunity identification and its operational capabilities, including CRM-embedded widgets that surface opportunity data and enable CS and sales to collaborate on success plans. It demonstrated differentiation with its correlation analysis, which helps teams identify which processes drive growth and which signals predict outcomes.

  View Gainsightâ€™s detailed scorecard.

### Strong Performers

#### ChurnZero

ChurnZero serves subscription-based businesses, with traction among midsize SaaS companies as well as traditional enterprises. The company has grown steadily since its founding in 2015 â€” it now has more than 700 customers and is supported by venture funding.

- **Strategy.** ChurnZero has a well-aligned strategy with a distinct viewpoint connecting its vision, innovation, and roadmap. Its focus on AI as a customer growth driver is grounded in customer needs like actionable insights and revenue impact. Innovation is on par relative to others in this evaluation, with the development of an AI teammate to reduce CSMsâ€™ task load and enable focus on strategic impact. The roadmap is built around four pillars, each tied to customer pain points and designed to deliver targeted outcomes. ChurnZeroâ€™s differentiated adoption strategy includes a benchmarking approach that compares customers across CX maturity pillars.

- **Capabilities.** ChurnZero offers superior AI-driven revenue forecasting capabilities, which help teams identify churn risks and growth signals. It also has strong expansion opportunity capabilities, with a CRM-embedded widget to support cross-functional collaboration between CS and sales. Its scaling capabilities are on par relative to others in this evaluation, with basic AI account summaries; next-best-action recommendations are slated for late 2025. AI-enhanced predictive workflow automation is an area for improvement.

- **Customer feedback.** Customers praised ChurnZeroâ€™s intuitive UI and data flexibility and noted strong support from the vendor, including senior leadership involvement. Some expressed a need for more depth in onboarding capabilities and more advanced AI features to extend the platformâ€™s utility.

- **Forresterâ€™s take.** ChurnZero is a top choice for midsize organizations or enterprises that need robust revenue tracking, a user-friendly interface, and consistently high-quality support.

  View ChurnZeroâ€™s detailed scorecard.

#### Planhat

Founded in Sweden, Planhat positions itself as a unified customer platform that serves B2B organizations with complex postsale needs. Its platform spans CS, services, and sales, with a design focused on unifying data and workflows across teams.

- **Strategy.** Planhatâ€™s vision is to unify the customer journey on a single platform designed for adaptability and speed of delivery. Its innovation strategy is on par relative to others in this evaluation, with an emphasis on combining CRM and AI capabilities developed largely in-house. Its main weakness is the roadmap, which lacked delivery timeline specifics, reflecting the vendorâ€™s preference for remaining flexible to place large strategic bets over fixed milestones. Pricing is clear and CSMs are part of standard packaging, earning the vendor on-par scores for pricing and supporting offerings.

- **Capabilities.** Planhatâ€™s project management capabilities for onboarding and implementation are top notch, enabling users to create multiple onboarding journeys, such as for different geographies or business units. Service delivery best-practice templates support resource planning and project budget revenue tracking for professional services teams. Revenue forecasting and management capabilities are also a notable strength, providing insight into renewal workflow progress and AI playbook recommendations for goals and plans. Areas for improvement include account multithreading, which is not as comprehensive as that of others in this evaluation.

- **Customer feedback.** Customers praised Planhatâ€™s modern UI, flexible data handling, and quick time to value after implementation, but they noted that customizing the platform, particularly reporting, can be complex.

- **Forresterâ€™s take.** Planhat is best suited for enterprises seeking a flexible, adaptable, and unified system for customer management.

  View Planhatâ€™s detailed scorecard.

### Contenders

#### HubSpot

HubSpotâ€™s core platform, which supports marketing, sales, and customer service applications, recently introduced a CS workspace within Service Hub. The platform is extended by commerce, content, and operations applications, which together power end-to-end customer operations, primarily for smaller teams.

- **Strategy.** HubSpotâ€™s vision aims to help CS teams make an impact on revenue and scale though intuitive, AI-enhanced systems â€” a direction aligned with its core market. Its roadmap focuses on improving CSM impact, connecting teams more directly to customer outcomes, and surfacing performance insights and coaching opportunities â€” but as a newer entrant, it is playing catch-up. While the workspace is still maturing relative to more established offerings, HubSpot earned top scores for its partner ecosystem, learning academy, and 24/7 support, reinforcing its potential to grow into a more competitive player.

- **Capabilities.** HubSpotâ€™s CS workspace is intuitive and easy to navigate; a highly configurable interface contributes to a strong UX. Its workflow and automation capabilities allow users to use the CRM data to build complex workflows, with prebuilt actions to streamline common tasks. However, the offering falls short in areas critical to mature CS practices, including revenue forecasting, retention, and expansion capabilities.

- **Customer feedback.** Reference customers praised HubSpotâ€™s simplicity and ease of use. However, they noted that their organization was already using the CRM, which strongly influenced the decision to invest in the workspace.

- **Forresterâ€™s take.** HubSpot best suits customers of the broader HubSpot suite as well as smaller teams seeking a tool that is easy to deploy and use.

  View HubSpotâ€™s detailed scorecard.

#### ClientSuccess

Headquartered near Salt Lake City, ClientSuccess supports CS, onboarding, and product feedback, with each module of the platform available independently or as part of an integrated suite. The company expanded its platform through its acquisitions of Baton in 2024 and Product Signals in 2025.

- **Strategy.** ClientSuccess positions its platform as a unified suite for CS, onboarding, and product feedback. Though the vendor emphasizes simplicity, ease of use, and rapid implementation, progress toward its broader vision of a natively integrated CX suite appears limited, with few notable developments beyond its recent acquisitions. Its customer adoption strategy, centered on training, education, and a library of online content, offers helpful resources to support ongoing learning and engagement.

- **Capabilities.** ClientSuccess excels at project management for customer onboarding and implementation, offering increased visibility into project status, alignment across teams, and support for time tracking and resource planning for professional services. Beyond this strength, the platformâ€™s support for core CS workflows appears limited, relying on a simplified design that lacks the depth found in more advanced solutions.

- **Customer feedback.** Customers appreciate how easy the product is to implement and use but mentioned limitations with key features, such as surveys and customer goal planning. ClientSuccess did not provide reference customers for this evaluation.

- **Forresterâ€™s take.** ClientSuccess is best suited for B2B organizations that want a platform that supports CS with limited complexity.

  View ClientSuccessâ€™ detailed scorecard.

#### Vitally

Vitally is a CSP used primarily by B2B SaaS companies to manage postsale processes and improve customer retention. Founded in 2017 and headquartered in New York, the venture-backed company received its last funding round, a Series B, in 2023.

- **Strategy.** Vitallyâ€™s vision positions CS teams as a growth engine instead of a cost center, an idea that reflects a well-established industry mindset rather than a novel shift. Its innovation strategy centers on developing AI agent capabilities for operational support and features that help CS teams better demonstrate business impact, addressing needs that customers have voiced before. The product roadmap lags those of others in this evaluation, and the partner ecosystem is not as robust.

- **Capabilities.** Vitally offers solid support for expansion capabilities through event-triggered alerts and workflows powered by AI-assisted identification of buying signals and opportunities. Its Docs feature and shared workspace links facilitate collaboration with customers on goals, plans, and business reviews. But the absence of a dedicated customer portal places it behind others in this evaluation that offer more robust, purpose-built collaboration environments. Revenue forecasting and reporting also fall short, relying primarily on health-score-driven probability, which lacks the depth and flexibility necessary for more advanced planning and analysis.

- **Customer feedback.** Customers appreciate Vitallyâ€™s simplicity in building automation, playbooks, and dashboards but noted that customer service was variable. Only one of Vitallyâ€™s reference customers responded to Forresterâ€™s outreach for this evaluation.

- **Forresterâ€™s take.** Vitally best suits B2B organizations that want a tool with easy-to-use workflow and automation capabilities.

  View Vitallyâ€™s detailed scorecard.

### Evaluation Overview

We evaluated vendors against three categories:

- **Current offering.** Each vendorâ€™s position on the vertical axis of the Forrester Wave graphic indicates the strength of its current offering.
- **Strategy.** Placement on the horizontal axis indicates the strength of the vendorsâ€™ strategies, including elements such as vision and innovation.
- **Customer feedback.** A halo on a vendorâ€™s marker indicates above-average customer feedback relative to the other evaluated vendors. A double halo indicates outstanding customer feedback: We consider the vendor to be a Customer Favorite. As part of this evaluation, we speak with up to three customers of each vendor. We also consider customer input from our previous research.

#### Vendor Inclusion Criteria

Each of the vendors we included in this assessment has:

- **Extended postsale engagement support.** The vendor offers support beyond core CS capabilities to enable postsale engagement across onboarding, adoption, and value realization. This includes capabilities that align with adjacent teams such as services, support, account management, or marketing.
- **A broad range of use cases for CS.** These cases enable a holistic approach to CS, including at least 50% of core CS capabilities: increase efficiency and scale the CS team, optimize retention and expansion efforts, enable success planning and customer outcomes delivery, accelerate onboarding and product adoption, and capture the voice of the customer.
- **Mindshare among Forresterâ€™s enterprise clients.** Forrester clients frequently mention the product as one they are considering before a purchase. We have heard about the product from our clients in the form of inquiries, advisories, consulting engagements, and other interactions over the past year. Other vendors mention this vendor as a competitor.

#### Other Notable Vendors

The Forrester Wave evaluation is an assessment of the top vendors in the market; it doesnâ€™t represent the entire vendor landscape. Youâ€™ll find more information about this market and additional vendors that Forrester considers to be notable for enterprise clients in our corresponding report: The Customer Success Platforms Landscape, Q2 2025.

### Supplemental Material

#### The Forrester Wave Methodology

A Forrester Wave is a guide for buyers considering their purchasing options in a technology marketplace. To offer an equitable process for all participants, Forrester follows The Forrester Waveâ„¢ Methodology to evaluate participating vendors.

In our review, we conduct primary research to develop a list of vendors to consider for the evaluation. From that initial pool of vendors, we narrow our final list based on the inclusion criteria. We then gather details of product and strategy through a detailed questionnaire, demos and briefings, and interviews with customers (vendors may provide up to three reference customers; we also consider feedback from other customers weâ€™ve spoken with). We use those inputs, along with the analystâ€™s experience and expertise in the marketplace, to score vendors, using a relative rating system that compares each vendor against the others in the evaluation.

We include the publishing date (quarter and year) clearly in the title of each Forrester Wave report. We evaluated the vendors participating in this Forrester Wave using materials they provided to us by July 18, 2025, and did not allow additional information after that point. We encourage readers to evaluate how the market and vendor offerings change over time.

In accordance with our vendor review policy, Forrester asks vendors to review our findings prior to publishing to check for accuracy. We score vendors that met our defined inclusion criteria but declined to participate in or contributed only partially to the evaluation in accordance with our vendor participation policy and publish their positioning along with those of the participating vendors.

ClientSuccess declined to participate in the full Forrester Wave evaluation process. For vendors that are not full participants, Forrester uses primary and secondary research in its analysis. For example, we might use public information, data gathered via briefings, and independently sourced customer interviews to score the vendor. We may ask the vendor for an abbreviated briefing and/or to provide reference customers. We may also rely on estimates to score vendors.

#### Integrity Policy

We conduct all our research, including Forrester Wave evaluations, in accordance with the integrity policy posted on our website.
