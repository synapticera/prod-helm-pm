## Executive Summary

Helm is positioned at the intersection of three converging enterprise trends:

1. **The Shift from Systems of Record to Systems of Decision**
   - Traditional enterprise software (Salesforce, Workday, SAP) captures WHAT happened
   - The emerging opportunity is capturing WHY it happened (decision traces, context, exceptions)

2. **The Rise of Execution Intelligence Layer / Decision Intelligence**
   - Venture capitalists call this "Execution Intelligence Layer" and "Context Graphs"
   - Analysts (Gartner) call this "Decision Intelligence"
   - Forrester calls this "Agent Control Plane"
   - All three are describing the same infrastructure gap and opportunity

3. **Customer Service as the Beachhead**
   - Service leaders operate without full visibility across domains (Systems, Process, Data, Team, Financials)
   - This is the "decision intelligence gap" that Helm solves
   - As AI agents proliferate in customer service, Helm provides the context intelligence they need to operate safely

## Market Category Definitions

### Taxonomy Comparison: How Different Groups Name the Same Thing

| **Concept** | **VC Terminology** | **Forrester Terminology** | **Gartner Terminology** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Layer Name** | Execution Intelligence Layer | Agent Control Plane | Decision Intelligence (DI) |
| **The Data Structure** | Context Graph | Governance & Audit Logs | Knowledge Graph / Composite AI |
| **The Core Artifact** | Decision Traces / Specs | Governance & Audit Logs | Decision Modeling |
| **Primary Focus** | Innovation/Startup Value | Governance/Safety | Business Logic/Optimization |

### Key Category Definitions

#### **Execution Intelligence Layer** (Ed Sim, Boldstart Ventures)
- Infrastructure layer between human intent and software execution
- Captures "decision traces"—living records of inputs, logic, exceptions, approvals, and outcomes
- Thesis: Agents need to move from "demos to systems" by enforcing "specs" (boundaries/rules) and recording execution paths

#### **Context Graphs** (Foundation Capital - Jaya Gupta & Ashu Garg)
- A graph that links people, policies, history, and decisions
- Makes the "why" searchable for AI agents
- Thesis: Next generation of enterprise software will be "Systems of Decision" that store organizational context required for autonomy
- Predicted as a "Trillion Dollar Opportunity"

#### **Decision Intelligence** (Gartner)
- The discipline of engineering how decisions are made
- Bridges the gap between Data (Insight) and Agents (Action)
- Technical approach: Composite AI (LLMs + Knowledge Graphs + Rule Sets) for accuracy and safety
- Ranked #1 tech trend for 2025 (Agentic AI)

#### **Agent Control Plane** (Forrester)
- Sits above agents to govern them (not trusting agents to police themselves)
- Enforces policies (e.g., spending limits)
- Audits the "decision traces" of why an agent took specific actions
- Part of 3-plane agentic architecture: Build Plane → Orchestration Plane → Agent Control Plane

## The Core Problem Being Solved

### What Current Systems Capture (State)
- "Ticket #123 is closed"
- "Invoice #456 was paid"
- "Case was resolved"

### What They DON'T Capture (Reasoning/Context)
- ❌ "Why was the ticket closed without resolution?" (e.g., customer stopped responding)
- ❌ "Why was the invoice paid despite being over budget?" (e.g., VP authorized an exception)
- ❌ "What precedents, approvals, and exceptions shaped this decision?"

### Why This Matters
**AI agents cannot safely execute work without decision context.** If an agent only sees the state, it lacks the tribal knowledge required for nuanced business decisions.

## Why This Matters for Helm

### Current Helm Positioning
"Helm is an AI-native executive command center that gives service leaders the tailored insight they need to evolve their operations with confidence and impact."

### How Helm Aligns with Emerging Category

1. **Captures Decision Context Across Dimensions**
   - Traditional CRM systems capture ticket state only
   - Helm captures the "why" across Systems, Process, Data, Team, Financials, Strategy
   - Creates organizational memory of how decisions are made in customer service

2. **Builds Decision Traces for Customer Service**
   - Mine module: Maps current state and establishes baseline
   - Design module: Defines decision rules and roadmap
   - Manage module: Continuously monitors execution and captures decision outcomes
   - This creates searchable, auditable decision traces

3. **Provides Context Intelligence for Future Agents**
   - As customer service AI agents proliferate, Helm becomes the source of truth for decision context
