## Executive Summary

McKinsey's 2025 State of AI report validates a critical market inflection: while AI adoption is widespread, **the gap between deployment and measurable business impact is widening**. Only 39% of organizations report EBIT-level impact despite 88% using AI regularly. The report identifies **AI agents as the frontier**, with 23% scaling agentic systems and 39% experimenting—but **workflow redesign emerges as the critical success factor** that separates winners from the majority.

**Key Insight for Helm**: McKinsey's finding that "workflow redesign has the biggest effect on EBIT impact" directly validates Helm's Design module positioning. Companies can't just deploy agents; they must redesign how work happens around agent capabilities.

---

## AI Adoption Landscape: Widespread but Shallow

### Current Adoption Status

- **88% of organizations** report regular AI use in at least one business function (up from 78% in 2024)
- **Growth rate**: +10 percentage points year-over-year
- **Deployment stage**: Majority still in experimentation or pilot phase
- **Scale status**: Approximately **1/3 have begun scaling** AI programs

**What This Means**: Adoption is broad, but depth is limited. Most companies are still in the exploration phase, not yet reaping productivity gains.

### Scaling Reality Check

**Only ~33% of organizations have moved beyond pilots to scaling.**

This aligns with other research showing:

- MIT: 34% stuck in Stage 2 (pilot phase)
- CustomerThink: 33% of service AI deployments will fail
- **Implication**: The majority face scaling challenges—exactly where Helm's Understand → Plan → Execute → Manage framework creates value

## The Business Impact Gap: Adoption ≠ ROI

### The Critical Statistic

| Metric                             | Finding                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Use-case level benefits**        | Reported by majority          |
| **Innovation enablement**          | 64% say AI enables innovation |
| **EBIT impact (enterprise-level)** | Only 39%                      |

**The Gap**: 88% using AI, but only 39% seeing measurable enterprise financial impact.

**Why This Matters**: Companies deploying agents without proper understanding, planning, or workflow redesign capture use-case benefits but miss enterprise-level ROI. This is the Helm opportunity.

### Root Cause: Incomplete Execution

McKinsey identifies the gap emerges because:

- Companies deploy agents as point solutions (use-case level)
- They don't redesign workflows around agent capabilities (enterprise level)
- Without workflow redesign, ROI remains isolated and doesn't compound

---

## The Frontier: AI Agents & Agentic Systems

### Agent Adoption Status

- **23% of respondents** report their organizations are **scaling an agentic AI system** somewhere in enterprise
- **39% report experimenting** with AI agents
- **38% not yet engaged** with agentic AI

**Total engaged with agents: 62% of organizations**

### Agent Readiness Maturity

| Stage              | % of Organizations | Status                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Scaling agents** | 23%                | Operational deployment |
| **Experimenting**  | 39%                | Pilot/proof-of-concept |
| **Not engaged**    | 38%                | Lagging category       |

**Implication**: Agentic AI is the current frontier, but most organizations are still in experimentation—exactly the stage where executive function (governance, transparency, decision context) becomes critical.

---

## High Performers: The Differentiation Pattern

### The High-Performer Advantage

McKinsey's analysis reveals **stark differences between high performers and others**:

**Agent Deployment Leadership**:

- **High performers are 3x more likely** to report scaling agents in most business functions
- **High performers are 3x more likely** to have advanced further with agent use cases
- **Data**: High performers concentrate in the "scaling" category; others cluster in "experimenting"

**Leadership Commitment**:

- **High performers 3x more likely** to report senior leadership demonstrates strong ownership and commitment to AI
- **High performers much more likely** to report senior leaders actively engaged in driving AI adoption
- **Pattern**: AI success correlates with executive sponsorship and organizational alignment

### What Separates High Performers

**Not Technical Capability** (agents exist everywhere)
**Not Funding** (most companies fund AI initiatives)
**Not Models** (access to Claude, GPT, others is equalized)

**What Actually Separates Them**:

1. **Executive alignment** on AI strategy and role
2. **Organizational commitment** to transformation (not just pilots)
3. **Workflow redesign** around agent capabilities
4. **Governance and oversight** of agent behavior
5. **Clear accountability** for outcomes

**Helm's Fit**: This is exactly what Helm's Mine/Design/Manage framework enables—organizational alignment, workflow redesign, governance, and accountability.

---

## The Critical Success Factor: Workflow Redesign

### McKinsey's Key Finding

> **"The redesign of workflows has the biggest effect on an organization's ability to see EBIT impact from its use of gen AI."**

This is the most important insight in the entire report.

### What This Means

**Simply deploying agents ≠ productivity gains**
**Deploying agents + redesigning workflows = EBIT impact**

### The Workflow Redesign Gap

- Companies see use-case benefits from agents
- But they don't systematically redesign processes around agent capabilities
- Without redesign, gains remain isolated and don't scale to enterprise ROI

**Why This Happens**:

1. Companies focus on "deploy the agent" (execution)
2. They skip "redesign the workflow" (transformation)
3. Agents operate as islands instead of integrated systems
4. Benefits remain at use-case level, not enterprise level

### How Helm Addresses This

**Helm's Design module is specifically built for workflow redesign**:

| Stage          | McKinsey Says                                | Helm's Answer                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Understand** | You must map current workflows               | Mine: Capture current process & decision patterns                      |
| **Design**     | Redesign workflows around agent capabilities | Design: Model how agents could handle tasks, what needs human judgment |
| **Execute**    | Deploy with governance                       | Manage: Enforce policies, monitor decisions, ensure compliance         |
| **Prove**      | Measure EBIT impact                          | Monitor: Track metrics, show ROI                                       |

## Risk Management Evolution: Escalating Complexity

### The Risk Landscape

McKinsey reports escalating focus on AI risk management:

| Timeline | Risk Focus                                       | Implication |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| **2022** | Companies managed average of 2 AI-related risks  |
| **2025** | Companies managing average of 4 AI-related risks | 2x increase |

**Trend**: As AI scales, risk management becomes more complex and critical.

### What Risks Companies Are Managing

- Model hallucination and accuracy
- Data quality and bias
- Regulatory compliance
- Operational reliability
- Decision transparency
- Agent behavior alignment

**Helm's Advantage**: Decision traces and governance infrastructure directly address multiple risk categories (compliance, transparency, behavior alignment, reliability).

---

## Market Implications for Helm

### 1. The Scaling Bottleneck Is Real

McKinsey confirms: **Only 1/3 of organizations have scaled beyond pilots**

This is the Helm market. The 2/3 stuck in pilots need:

- **Understand**: How do we map our current operations?
- **Plan**: How do we design workflows around agents?
- **Execute**: How do we ensure agents work as intended?
- **Prove**: How do we measure and improve?

### 2. Workflow Redesign Is Non-Negotiable for ROI

McKinsey's explicit finding: Workflow redesign has the biggest impact on EBIT.

This validates Helm's Design module as essential infrastructure—not nice-to-have, but mandatory for ROI.

### 3. High Performers Have Executive Alignment

The 3x difference in agent scaling correlates with senior leadership engagement.

Helm helps enable this alignment by providing visibility, transparency, and shared context for decisions.

### 4. Risk Management Will Drive Governance Adoption

As companies scale agents (and manage more risks), governance infrastructure becomes essential.

Helm's audit trails, decision traces, and compliance capabilities directly address this need.

### 5. The EBIT Gap Creates Urgency

39% seeing enterprise-level impact = 61% seeing only use-case benefits

Companies in that 61% will be actively looking for solutions to improve ROI. This creates market urgency for Q2-Q3 2026.

## Strategic Narrative for Helm

### The McKinsey Validation

McKinsey's 2025 research validates Helm's core thesis from multiple angles:

1. **Scale Exists**: 23% scaling agents, 39% experimenting = 62% engaged with agentic AI
2. **Scale Requires Infrastructure**: Only 39% seeing EBIT impact despite 88% deployment
3. **Workflow Redesign Drives ROI**: Explicitly identified as #1 success factor
4. **Executive Alignment Matters**: High performers 3x more likely to have aligned leadership
5. **Risk Management Escalating**: Companies managing 2x more risks as AI scales

### Why This Matters

- **Market Expansion**: Agentic AI is becoming mainstream (23% scaling, 39% experimenting)
- **Execution Gap**: Most companies can deploy agents but can't execute full workflow redesign + governance
- **ROI Crisis**: 61% of companies not seeing enterprise-level ROI despite deployment
- **Regulatory Pressure**: Risk management escalating; governance infrastructure becomes essential
- **Leadership Imperative**: C-suite recognizing AI success requires organizational alignment, not just technology

### Helm's Positioning

Helm is the infrastructure that enables the **complete workflow redesign + governance lifecycle** that McKinsey identifies as the critical success factor for EBIT-level impact.
