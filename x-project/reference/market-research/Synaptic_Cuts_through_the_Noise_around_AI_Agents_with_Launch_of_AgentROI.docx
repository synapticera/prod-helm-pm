**Synaptic Cuts through the Noise around AI Agents with Launch of
AgentROI.com**

*New tool addresses concerns about AI project failure rates with
pre-build impact analysis for business executives and process owners*

As the AI landscape hits a credibility crisis --- with an MIT study
showing that 95% of AI agent initiatives fail to deliver measurable
outcomes --- Synaptic today unveiled *AgentROI*, a practical answer to
the hype. Rather than chasing abstract intelligence, *AgentROI* grounds
AI investment in data. The platform automatically maps how work actually
happens across enterprise systems, exposing the processes, costs, and
effort where automation can create real returns.  Pulling from industry
best practice data and real world project knowledge, it gives leaders
evidence-based insight and a clear ROI roadmap to move from experimental
agents to proven impact.
