# AF: Discovery MVP User Journey: From Process Chaos to Operational Excellence

Here\'s how a customer support leader transforms their operations using
AgentFinder, presented as a seamless journey from initial pain point to
measurable business impact:

### **The Starting Point: Sarah\'s Challenge**

Sarah, VP of Customer Success at a 500-person SaaS company, knows her
support operations are inefficient but can\'t pinpoint exactly where or
why. Her team handles 3,500 tickets monthly across email, phone, and
chat, but customer satisfaction is declining while costs are rising.

### **Step 1: The 5-Minute Discovery Interview**

Sarah logs into AgentFinder and immediately starts a conversational
interview. The AI interviewer feels like talking to an expert
consultant - asking targeted questions about her domain
\"acmesupport.com\", support channels, and critically, the systems her
team uses daily: \"Do you use Salesforce for case management? Slack for
internal communication? What about your knowledge base?\" The system
automatically enriches the conversation with company context from her
domain.

**Key UX Moment:** The split-screen interface keeps her engaged -
interview on the left, real-time process catalog building on the right.
She sees immediate value accumulating as she speaks. The interview is
concise and focused, respecting her time.

### **Step 2: Automated Data Fusion (The Magic Happens)**

While Sarah continues the interview, she drags and drops her existing
Visio diagram of their \"ideal\" process into the system. She then
clicks \"Connect Salesforce\" - a simple OAuth flow grants read-only
access to their case data.

**Transformation Point:** Within 60 seconds of completing the interview,
AgentFinder synthesizes all three data sources - her narrative, the
Visio diagram, and 6 months of actual Salesforce case history - into a
living process model.

### **Step 3: The Reality Check**

Sarah sees her actual processes for the first time. The interactive
canvas shows three distinct workflows that emerged from the data:

-   Email Support (2,456 cases/month)

-   Phone Support (1,890 cases/month)

-   Escalation Process (234 cases/month)

The heatmap overlay immediately draws her attention - red nodes indicate
bottlenecks. She hovers over \"Agent Assignment\" and discovers it\'s
consuming 10.8 FTEs at \$780,000 annually, with an 8% rework rate.

**Key Insight:** The confidence indicators (82%, 76%, 71%) show the
system\'s transparency - this isn\'t black-box magic, every element
links back to evidence from her interview, artifacts, or Salesforce
data.

### **Step 4: Interactive Refinement**

Sarah notices the system identified a \"Billing Queue\" that was
actually consolidated last quarter. She simply deletes the node and
reconnects the workflow. The system saves this as Version 2, maintaining
full audit trail. She updates the default salary assumption from \$65K
to their actual \$72K average, and all cost metrics recalculate
instantly.

### **Step 5: The Roadmap Reveal**

The moment of truth - Sarah clicks \"Generate Recommendations\" and
receives a stack-ranked list of improvements:

**Top Recommendation:** \"Automate Password Reset Requests\"

-   ROI: 4.1x (410% return)

-   Implementation Cost: \$30,000

-   Annual Savings: \$131,040

-   Payback Period: 2.7 months

-   Evidence: 1,456 password reset tickets/month taking 15 minutes each

The system doesn\'t just identify opportunities - it quantifies them
with hard data from her actual operations.

### **Step 6: Strategic Decision Making**

Sarah filters recommendations by timeline to find \"quick wins\" for Q1.
She can see exactly which process nodes each recommendation impacts. The
trade-off analysis is explicit - for the chatbot recommendation, the
system warns about the need for a clear \"talk to human\" escape path
and suggests starting with password resets only.

### **Step 7: From Insight to Action**

Sarah marks three recommendations as priorities, adds notes about budget
constraints, and publishes the process as the official baseline. The
published version becomes the single source of truth - any future edits
create new versions without losing this snapshot of current state.

### **The Outcome: Measurable Transformation**

In under 1 hour, Sarah has:

-   Discovered her actual (not assumed) process flows

-   Identified \$500K+ in annual savings opportunities

-   Created a prioritized roadmap with ROI calculations

-   Established a baseline for measuring improvements

-   Armed herself with data-driven justification for automation
    > investments

### **The Delight Factor**

The interface respects Sarah\'s expertise while augmenting it with
AI-powered analysis. She\'s not fighting with complex process notation
or spending weeks in discovery workshops. The system shows its work -
every recommendation cites specific evidence, building trust through
transparency.

### **Post-MVP Enhancement (The Growth Path)**

As Sarah returns in subsequent weeks, the system detects anti-patterns
like \"status ping-pong\" where cases bounce between states,
automatically flagging systemic issues. The confidence scores have
evolved to show not just a number, but the convergence of multiple
signals that support each recommendation.

### **Step 6: Strategic Orchestration - Building the Automation Journey**

Sarah sees her complete automation evolution laid out. She filters by
timeline to sequence implementation:

**Quarter 1 (Quick Wins):** Process improvements requiring no new
technology - just workflow changes

**Quarter 2 (Foundation):** System integrations that lay groundwork for
automation - connecting Slack, APIs, and knowledge bases

**Quarter 3-4 (Intelligence Layer):** Progressive AI deployment:

-   Start with human-in-the-loop AI agents where humans validate
    > decisions

-   Gradually increase autonomy as confidence builds

-   Eventually reach full autonomy for high-confidence, high-volume
    > tasks

The trade-off analysis is explicit - for the autonomous chatbot, the
system shows:

-   **Benefits:** 24/7 availability, instant resolution, 40% deflection
    > rate

-   **Considerations:** Needs clear escalation path, requires 2-3 months
    > of training

-   **Mitigation:** Start with narrow use case (password resets), expand
    > gradually

Sarah can see the complete journey from manual processes to intelligent
automation, with each step building on the previous, reducing risk while
maximizing ROI.

### **Step 7: From Insight to Action**

Sarah marks three recommendations as priorities across all categories -
a process improvement for immediate impact, a Slack integration for Q2,
and the password reset AI agent for Q3. She publishes the process as the
official baseline with her strategic roadmap attached.

### **The Outcome: Measurable Transformation**

In under 1 hour, Sarah has:

-   Discovered her actual (not assumed) process flows

-   Identified \$500K+ in annual savings opportunities across process,
    > systems, and AI improvements

-   Created a phased automation journey from quick wins to full autonomy

-   Established a baseline for measuring improvements

-   Armed herself with data-driven justification for each stage of
    > automation investment

### **The Delight Factor**

The interface respects Sarah\'s expertise while augmenting it with
AI-powered analysis. She\'s not fighting with complex process notation
or spending weeks in discovery workshops. The system shows her not just
what to fix, but the entire spectrum of how to evolve - from simple
process tweaks to fully autonomous AI agents.

### **Post-MVP Enhancement (The Growth Path)**

As Sarah returns in subsequent weeks, the system detects anti-patterns
like \"status ping-pong\" where cases bounce between states,
automatically flagging systemic issues. The confidence scores have
evolved to show not just a number, but the convergence of multiple
signals that support each recommendation.
