## The $Trillion Dollar Opportunity

### What Foundation Capital Is Saying

2026 represents a **$Trillion Dollar Opportunity** to build organizational memory and decision context infrastructure.

### Core Thesis

**"Systems of Decision" will replace "Systems of Record"**

- **Systems of Record** (Salesforce, SAP, etc.): Store what happened
- **Systems of Decision** (Helm, etc.): Store how decisions were made, context, precedents, outcomes

### Why It Matters

Organizations are sitting on massive untapped assets:

- **Decision traces** (every decision, outcome, context)
- **Organizational memory** (precedents, patterns, best practices)
- **Context graphs** (relationships between decisions, data, people, policies)

The company that captures and monetizes this wins.

## Context Graphs as Competitive Moat

### What Is a Context Graph?

A rich, structured record of:

- **Who** made a decision
- **What** decision was made
- **Why** (context, precedents, factors considered)
- **When** (timing, urgency, season)
- **Where** (department, geography, business unit)
- **Outcome** (result, ROI, learning)

### Why It's a Moat

1. **Network Effects**: More customers → richer context graph → smarter recommendations
2. **Switching Costs**: Customers' data becomes locked in your system
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Competitors can't replicate years of decision data
4. **First-Mover**: Company that captures decision traces first owns them

### Analogy

- Salesforce owns "Systems of Record" (CRM data) = Multi-billion dollar company
- Helm owns "Systems of Decision" (decision traces) = Next generation winner

## How This Applies to Helm

### Helm's Context Graph Strategy

**Mine Module** = Builds context graphs of decision patterns
**Design Module** = Leverages context graphs to design better processes
**Manage Module** = Enforces policies, captures outcomes, enriches context graph
**Network Effects** = Fleet learning (50K+ customers × millions of decisions = massive context graph advantage)

### Helm's Data Moat

Every customer interaction creates data Helm captures:

- Service agents' decisions
- Escalation patterns
- Resolution outcomes
- Customer satisfaction impact

This becomes Helm's defensible moat:

- Year 1: Baseline decision visibility
- Year 2: Pattern recognition (what works in this service vertical)
- Year 3: Predictive (AI makes smarter decisions based on 2M+ precedents)
- Year 4+: Unbeatable (competitors can't catch up; data moat compounds)

## Market Size & Opportunity

### TAM Expansion

**Immediate TAM** (Customer Service): $2-3B

- 70K Service Cloud customers
- 40% adopting agents (28K)
- $25K-$50K decision intelligence budget

**Extended TAM** (All Enterprise Functions): $50B+

- Finance, Operations, HR, Sales, IT
- Same context graph infrastructure
- Decision traces become standard

### Venture Scale

Foundation Capital sees this as a $1B+ company opportunity:

- Capture context graphs in one vertical first (Service)
- Expand to adjacent verticals with proven moat
- Become "the decision intelligence platform" across enterprise

## How to Use This in Messaging

### Investor Pitch

"Just like Salesforce built a $200B company capturing Systems of Record, we're building Systems of Decision. Foundation Capital estimates this $Trillion Dollar Opportunity in organizational context capture. We're starting with customer service—the highest-ROI, highest-urgency vertical."

### Product Messaging

"Every decision your team makes is data. Helm captures it, learns from it, makes future decisions smarter. That's your competitive advantage."

### Long-Term Vision

"We're not building a tool. We're building your organization's decision memory. The more you use Helm, the smarter your decisions become. That's defensible moat."

### Analyst Briefing

"Context graphs are becoming the core infrastructure for AI governance. We're building context graph capture for service operations."

## Key Insight

> "The winner in this market will be the company that captures and owns organizational decision context first. By 2027, that context graph will be worth more than the company initially."
> — Foundation Capital thesis

This validates Helm's long-term positioning: We're not selling a product; we're building your organization's decision memory.
