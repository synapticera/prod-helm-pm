Vision
— its part agent, part manager, an intelligent agent manager not just the doer
	- process agent… 
	- next step around process not just tasks…
- Digital twin concept. We are building the digital twin for the executive or manager. The current digital twins are for the executors, which is what Vive coding is about. This is about managing, planning, and operating the business. And so we're building the digital twin for that next level, which is what the next 24 months is about.

- From task to autonomy
- Value of execution is zero, only hope is strategy and assurance
- Not AI only…. Wholistic…. Includes….
- Discovering opps may surface where to build… 
- PLG
- Fast
- Founder led
- Defensible
- When something is no longer difficult you see a rise in that was previously difficult
    - e.g. building great software to track ROI, tacking ROI
- The future of agents is agents working quietly in the background
- Omega (end game), 
- AI Q tests as marketing tool and diagnostic 
- Derived from the observation that clients are not taking a process centric approach which is what is needed
