# B2B SaaS Customer Service Metrics Hierarchy

## Summary

**Key Learnings:**
- Created iterative versions of a Customer Service metrics hierarchy diagram adapted from B2B SaaS benchmarking frameworks
- Evolved from complex multi-color design to simplified blue/grey color scheme for clarity
- Structured metrics into three main tiers: Case Assessment, Response Effectiveness, and Response Efficiency
- Developed both general SaaS benchmarking scorecard and AARP-specific member services hierarchy
- Added Business Impact layer with CS Net Impact Index for measuring comparative performance
- Transitioned from arrow-heavy flow diagrams to clean, box-based hierarchical structure

**Key Points:**
- **Three Core Metric Categories:** Case Assessment (volume, intent, root cause, complexity, severity), Response Effectiveness (preventability, resolution quality, first contact resolution, team performance), Response Efficiency (channel mix, resolution mix, resolution speed, resolution cost)
- **Design Philosophy:** Simplicity through blues/greys only, no unnecessary arrows, consistent box styling at each tier
- **Business Impact Focus:** CS Net Impact Index with comparative benchmarking (industry vs. historical)
- **Multiple Iterations:** Simple → Expanded → v2 (HTML/JSX) → v4 → Final version
- **Membership Model Adaptation:** Created AARP-specific version adapting from general SaaS metrics
- **Interactive Scoring Tool:** Discussion of "Frozen Pragmatists" scores and future vision/roadmap metrics

## Conversation

### Initial Request
[User provided an image/diagram as basis]

User requested creation of a new CS Support Metric Hierarchy diagram based on a B2B SaaS benchmark scorecard with specific requirements:
- Use only blues and greys (not green or orange)
- Follow the original closely but simplify
- Remove extra works and little arrows - just overall general flow
- Remove big arrows
- Use boxes consistently at each tier

### Claude's First Iteration - Simplified Hierarchy

**Created:** "Saas benchmark scorecard simple" (HTML)

The visual immediately tells the story: **strong effectiveness, weak efficiency** — with self-service being the clear outlier dragging down the composite score.

Here's the simplified hierarchy with:
- **Blues and greys only** — no green or orange
- **No arrows** — just three clean columns
- **Consistent box styling** at each tier
- **Minimal text** — just the essentials

### User Feedback
"i like it. lets add a few more of the metrics back."

### Claude's Second Iteration - Expanded Version

**Created:** "Saas benchmark scorecard expanded" (HTML)

Here's the expanded version with 10 metrics across the hierarchy:

**Section** | **Metrics**
---|---
**Case Assessment** | Case Volume, Preventability Rate
**Response Effectiveness** | Resolution Quality (CSAT), First Contact Resolution, Team Performance
**Response Efficiency** | Self-Service Rate, Time to Resolution, Cost per Case

### User Request for New CS Hierarchy

"pls use this diagram as the basis to create a new CS Support Metric Herorchy diagram. oplease only use blues and greys (not green or orange) and follow this closely. make it very simple (do no not need extra works and little arrows, just othe overall general flow). remove the big arrows as well and use boxes consistently at each tier"

### Claude's CS Metrics Hierarchy v2

**Created:**
- "Cs metrics hierarchy v2" (HTML)
- "Cs metrics hierarchy v2" (JSX)

**Changes made:**
- Blues and greys only (no cyan, green, or orange)
- Removed the big triangle arrows
- Kept consistent box styling (grey for questions, blue for metrics)
- Preserved the 3 groups with all 6 question/metric pairs

**Right Column:**
- CS Impact Index

### Claude's CS Metrics Hierarchy v4

**Created:** "Cs metrics hierarchy v4" (HTML)

**Left Column:**
- **Need for Support:** Volume, Intent, Root Cause, Complexity, Severity
- **Response Effectiveness:** Preventability, Resolution Quality, First Contact Resolution, Team Performance
- **Response Efficiency:** Channel Mix, Resolution Mix, Resolution Speed, Resolution Cost

**Middle Column** (styled boxes like original):
- **Effectiveness box** with "Doing the RIGHT things" subtitle → Net Retention (with Expansion Rate, Renewal Rate details)
- × multiply symbol
- **Efficiency box** with "Doing things RIGHT" subtitle → Cost to Serve (with Total Cost, Total Revenue details)

**Right Column** (styled impact box):
- **Business Impact** label → CS Net Impact Index → Comparative Benchmark (vs. Industry, vs. Historical)

This combines the comprehensive metric listing from your image with the richer formatting on the intermediate and final outputs.

### User Request: Add Missing Metrics

"Want me to adjust any of the metrics or add/remove any?"

### User Request for AARP Version

[User asks Claude to create AARP Member Services version]

### Claude: AARP Member Services Hierarchy

**Created:** "Aarp member services hierarchy" (Code JSX)

Here's the AARP Member Services Hierarchy.

I don't see an AARP-specific benchmark scorecard in the outputs - we have the hierarchy diagram but not a scorecard version. Would you like me to create an AARP Member Services Benchmark Scorecard using the same visual style as the updated SaaS one, adapted for AARP's membership model metrics?

### User Request: Interactive Scoring Tool Update

"in the interactive scoring. Let's update the frozen pragmatists to have ones for future vision and roadmap, at least there's something there."

### Claude's Response

I don't see the interactive scoring tool with "Frozen Pragmatists" in the current outputs or recent conversations. Could you either:

1. Share/upload the file so I can update it, or
2. Let me know which project it's in?

Alternatively, if you'd like me to recreate it from scratch, just describe what the interactive scoring tool includes and I'll build it with the Frozen Pragmatists having 1s for Future Vision and Roadmap.

### User Request

"show me the aarp scorecard again"

[Conversation continues with Claude generating the AARP scorecard with interactive elements]

### Final Iteration

**Created:** "Cs metrics hierarchy final" (Code JSX)

[Final polished version incorporating all feedback and refinements]
