# Emerging Decision Intelligence Category Research

## Summary

**Key Learnings:**
- Identified emerging enterprise AI category forming around multiple converging concepts: Context Graphs, Decision Intelligence, Execution Intelligence Layer, and Enterprise Context Management
- Category is crystallizing with thought leaders from Foundation Capital (Jaya Gupta), Boldstart Ventures (Ed Sim), and major analysts (Gartner, IDC)
- Core thesis: shift from "systems of record" (capturing WHAT happened) to "systems of record for decisions" (capturing WHY it happened with full context)
- Decision traces, not just data, are becoming the key asset for enterprise AI
- Structural advantage goes to startups in the "orchestration path" who see decisions at execution time
- Multiple "Superagent" entities exist in the market with different positioning (guardrails, CRM automation, insurance-specific)

**Key Points:**
- **Category Names:** Context Graphs, Decision Intelligence, Execution Intelligence Layer, Enterprise Context Management
- **Key Thought Leaders:** Jaya Gupta & Ashu Garg (Foundation Capital), Ed Sim (Boldstart), Aaron Levie (Box), Mark Palmer, Gartner
- **Core Innovation:** Capturing decision-time context including inputs, intent, constraints, history, permissions, exceptions, and alternatives
- **Market Timing:** Category crystallizing in late 2024/early 2025 with formal analyst recognition
- **Helm Relevance:** Aligns perfectly with Helm's Context Framework and archetype-based approach to customer service decisions
- **Superagent Landscape:** Term is being used by multiple entities - guardrails platform (YC-backed), CRM automation, insurance vertical, and general concept

### User
take a look at this article. need to do deep research to see who is writing about this and what the.

[After fetching and researching the article and related sources]

This is a great article from Ed Sim's "What's Hot in Enterprise IT/VC" newsletter. The key themes are:

**Execution Intelligence Layer** - a new abstraction layer that sits between intent and infrastructure

**Context** - not just data, but decision-time understanding including inputs, intent, constraints, history, permissions, exceptions, alternatives

**Decision traces** - capturing how decisions were made, not just what happened

**Systems of agents** - startups that sit in the orchestration path have structural advantage

The article references several key thinkers:
- Ivan Zhao (Notion) - "Steam, Steel and Infinite Minds"
- Aaron Levie (Box) - "Jevon's Paradox for Knowledge Work"
- Jaya Gupta (Foundation Capital) - "AI's Trillion dollar Opportunity: Context Graphs"

There's also a comment from Mark Palmer mentioning:
- Enterprise Context Management Substack
- The Propagation Substack
- Foundation Capital's Context Graphs post

[After extensive research on spec-driven development, decision intelligence, and related topics]

Now I have a comprehensive view of the emerging category. Let me synthesize all this research into a clear picture for you.

## Bill's Comprehensive Synthesis

### The Emerging Category: What's Forming

There are **multiple names converging on the same concept**, which is actually a great sign that a category is crystallizing:

**Primary Terms Being Used:**

1. **Context Graphs** (Foundation Capital / Jaya Gupta)
2. **Decision Intelligence** (Gartner, IDC, Quantexa)
3. **Execution Intelligence Layer** (Ed Sim's term)
4. **Enterprise Context Management** (Mark Palmer's framing)
5. **Systems of Record for Decisions** (vs. traditional systems of record for data)

### Key Voices & Sources

#### Tier 1: Category Definers

**Jaya Gupta & Ashu Garg (Foundation Capital)** - Published December 22, 2025
Their piece "Context Graphs: AI's Trillion-Dollar Opportunity" is becoming a seminal reference. They coined the term **decision traces**.

Key insight: "Agents don't just need rules. They need access to the decision traces that show how rules were applied, when exceptions were made, and what precedents exist."

**Ed Sim (Boldstart Ventures)** - Weekly newsletter "What's Hot in Enterprise IT/VC"
He's synthesizing across the ecosystem and coined "Execution Intelligence Layer"

**Aaron Levie (Box CEO)** - "Jevon's Paradox for Knowledge Work"
His argument: AI won't shrink knowledge work - it will massively expand it by making it cheaper. The bottleneck shifts from "can we afford to do this analysis?" to "how do we decide what to do with all this insight?"

#### Tier 2: Emerging Voices

**Mark Palmer** - Two Substacks: "Techno Sapien" and "Enterprise Context Management"
Former CEO, now writing about context as the core competitive asset

**Gartner** - Formally recognizing "Decision Intelligence" as an emerging category in their 2025 Hype Cycle for Data & Analytics

**IDC + Aera Technology** - Research paper "Accelerating Enterprise Decision Intelligence with AI Agents" - claiming 88% of enterprise decisions still rely on gut feel

**theCUBE Research** - "Agentic AI Futures Index" showing 62% of companies now see AI agents as key to decision-making, but only 18% have production deployments

#### Tier 3: Ecosystem Commentary

Multiple Substacks and thought pieces are amplifying these ideas:
- Abhi Yadav's "2025 Was the Year AI's Missing Layer Became Obvious"
- Subramanya N's analysis connecting Context Graphs to agentic infrastructure
- Various Medium posts breaking down the Foundation Capital thesis

### The Core Thesis (Synthesized)

1. **Systems of record captured WHAT happened** (Salesforce, Workday, SAP)
2. **The new opportunity is capturing WHY it happened** - the decision traces, exceptions, approvals, and precedents
3. **Context ≠ metadata or prompts** - it's decision-time understanding: inputs, intent, constraints, history, permissions, exceptions, alternatives
4. **Startups in the "orchestration path" have structural advantage** - they see full context at decision time, not after the fact via ETL
5. **The feedback loop is the moat** - captured decision traces become searchable precedent, and every automated decision adds another training example

### Why This Matters for Helm

This is **exactly** what your Context Framework and archetype-based approach is addressing. Your five dimensions (operational, financial, team, customer experience, strategic) are capturing decision context across customer service operations.

The gap you've identified - executives making decisions without visibility across these dimensions - is precisely the "decision intelligence gap" this emerging category is addressing.

**Strategic opportunities from this research:**

1. **Category alignment**: Consider whether "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service" or "Context Intelligence" resonates better than just "AI command center"
2. **Decision traces angle**: Your framework could explicitly capture how executives make decisions - building the "decision record" alongside operational data
3. **The "systems of agents" framing**: Helm sits in the orchestration path for customer service decisions, giving you structural advantage as agents proliferate
4. **AI-native differentiation**: The thesis is that "AI-first" companies have an edge because they're capturing decision context from day one, not retrofitting it onto legacy systems

### Who to Watch

If you want to stay on top of this emerging category:

- **Ed Sim's newsletter** - whatshotit.vc (weekly synthesis)
- **Foundation Capital's Ideas page** - foundationcapital.com/ideas
- **Mark Palmer's Substacks** - technosapien.substack.com and enterprisecontextmanagement.substack.com
- **Gartner's Decision Intelligence coverage** - they're formalizing the category

The timing is right. This category is crystallizing **right now**, and you're building exactly what the thesis describes. The challenge is positioning Helm so investors and prospects immediately see the category fit.

how about superagent?

### Claude
[After researching multiple "Superagent" entities]

Found a few different "Superagent" entities in the AI space. Here's what's out there:

#### 1. Superagent.sh (Y Combinator-backed)

The most notable one - an open-source framework for building, running, and controlling AI agents with safety guardrails. [Referenced in Help Net Security article]

**Key positioning:** Guardrails for agentic AI - "Our safety agent integrates with your AI to stop prompt injections, jailbreaks, leaks, and unwanted hallucinations." [From Superagent.sh]

**Focus areas:**
- Guard (98% threat detection for prompt injections)
- Verify (grounds outputs against enterprise sources)
- Observability & control

[GitHub: 10K+ stars]

#### 2. SuperAGI.com

Agentic AI platform focused on CRM/sales automation. Claims 80% reduction in manual data entry, 90% increase in lead response times. [From SuperAGI]

#### 3. getsuperagent.com

Vertical-specific: "Complete Autonomous AI Workforce for Insurance" - 6 agents available now, 3 more coming soon. [From Getsuperagent]

#### 4. "Super-Agent" as a Category Concept

Emerging terminology for "sophisticated, multi-functional systems capable of managing complex tasks, coordinating multiple agents, and orchestrating workflows autonomously." [From Medium article]

Architecture layers typically include:
- Perception Layer (multimodal data)
- Knowledge Layer (ERPs, CRMs, documents)
- Reasoning Layer (LLMs, causal models)
- Execution Layer (API integrations, automation)
- Orchestration Layer (workflows, multi-agent coordination)

[Referenced in Medium article]

**Are you asking about:**
1. One of these specific companies as a potential competitor/reference?
2. "Superagent" as a naming candidate for Helm?
3. The concept as category positioning (super-agent vs. decision intelligence vs. context graphs)?

The naming angle is interesting - it's less crowded than you might expect, but "Superagent.sh" has strong mindshare in the developer community with their YC pedigree and open-source approach.
