## Executive Summary

**The Market Inflection: From Agent Capability to Agent Management**

The 2026 AI market is experiencing a fundamental inflection: companies are moving from **"Can we build AI agents?"** to **"How do we manage AI agents safely, effectively, and compliantly?"**

This inflection reflects a deeper truth: **The AI industry has solved the "arms and legs" problem. Management is now the constraint.**

Just as software development evolved from "how do we build code?" → "how do we deploy code?" → "who decides WHAT code to build?" (solved by product management tooling), AI is now at: "we can build agents" → "we can deploy agents" → "**who decides HOW agents should decide?**" (this is unsolved and is where Helm comes in).

The evidence:

- 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by end of 2026
- But ~33% of service AI deployments will fail—not because agents aren't smart enough, but because there's no executive function layer managing them
- Companies can deploy agents, but can't answer: "Why did the agent make this decision?" "How do we course-correct?" "What context should it use?"

**This inflection reveals an emerging infrastructure category** that multiple industry voices are identifying using different terminology but describing the same concept:

| **Term**                         | **Who Uses It**          | **Focus**                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Graphs**               | Foundation Capital (VCs) | Structured organizational memory for agents  |
| **Execution Intelligence Layer** | Ed Sim / Boldstart (VCs) | Specs + execution path recording             |
| **Agent Control Plane**          | Forrester (Analysts)     | Governance and audit over autonomous systems |
| **Decision Intelligence**        | Gartner (Analysts)       | Engineering how decisions are made           |

**The Category Thesis**: Traditional enterprise systems (Salesforce, SAP, Workday) store **WHAT happened** (state). The emerging category stores **WHY it happened** (decision traces, context, exceptions, approvals). Agents cannot operate safely without this "why" layer.

### Helm's Strategic Positioning

**Helm is the Executive Agent for Service Leaders** — providing the executive function infrastructure that separates winners (5-7x productivity gains) from those wasting 90% of their opportunity (95% of AI projects fail).

This positioning is grounded in an emerging infrastructure category that industry voices describe as Decision Intelligence, Agent Control Planes, Execution Intelligence Layer, or Context Graphs—all capturing the same essential need: agents cannot operate safely without the executive function layer to understand decisions, design policies, execute with governance, and continuously improve.

Helm's positioning is validated by:

1. **Market Inflection** (2026):
   - 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by end of 2026
   - ~33% of service AI deployments will fail due to lack of decision infrastructure
   - 60% of Fortune 100 will appoint Chief AI Officer (creating governance demand)
   - Regulatory pressure: EU AI Act effective August 2, 2026 (demanding transparency & audit)

2. **Category Alignment**:
   - Gartner, Forrester, and Foundation Capital all converge on need for decision infrastructure
   - Helm's Mine/Design/Manage naturally captures decision traces and governance
   - First-mover advantage in claiming "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service"

3. **Vertical Specialization Win** (Ed Sim's Research):
   - Vertical specialists beat horizontal infrastructure plays
   - Customer service is largest AI deployment use case
   - Domain expertise + decision data = defensible network effects moat

4. **Product/Market Fit**:
   - Mine: Capture decisions from customer service interactions
   - Design: Model and governance decision policies
   - Manage: Govern and optimize agent decision-making
   - Result: Decision traces become precedent library that improves recommendations over time

### The Positioning Decision

After analyzing three positioning candidates:

- **Helm (Current)**: "AI-native executive command center..." (strong brand, weak category signal)
- **Decision Intelligence for CS**: "Decision Intelligence Platform for Customer Service" (analyst-friendly, but requires buyer education)
- **Executive Agent for Service Leaders**: "Executive Agent for Service Leaders" (what the market will buy and come to think of as the category)

**Winner**: **"Executive Agent for Service Leaders"**

**Strategic Rationale**:

- Everyone will eventually have personal agents. Helm is starting with executives (service leaders) who have the most complex decisions and highest ROI from automation.
- "Executive Agent" is what the market will understand and adopt as the category—intuitive, buyer-centric language.
- The underlying infrastructure (Decision Intelligence, governance, decision traces, policy enforcement) remains the technical foundation, but it's the supporting narrative, not the primary sell.

This positioning:

- ✅ Resonates with buyers (service leaders understand "executive agent" intuitively)
- ✅ Defines the emerging category as "Executive Agent" (ahead of competitors)
- ✅ Emphasizes vertical specialization (Ed Sim's winning strategy—starting with executives in customer service)
- ✅ Enables expansion path (Finance executives, Operations executives, HR executives, eventually all knowledge workers)
- ✅ Maintains technical credibility (Decision Intelligence underpins the architecture for compliance and governance)
- ✅ Scales the narrative (everyone gets an agent; we're starting with the highest-ROI segment)
- ✅ Aligns with investor thesis (category ownership before market crystallizes)

## Market Research Validation: McKinsey, Bain, MIT Evidence

### Enterprise AI Adoption Reality (McKinsey 2025)

- **88% of enterprises** are already using AI in some form
- **Only 6%** are seeing real financial impact (5%+ EBIT improvement)—a massive execution gap
- **90% of promising AI use cases are stuck in pilot mode** (the "Pilot Purgatory" problem Helm solves)
- **23% of enterprises** are actively scaling AI agents to production
- **92% plan to increase AI budgets** despite the execution gap (creating massive TAM)

**Helm Implication**: The massive execution gap (88% using AI but only 6% seeing impact) validates that understanding + governance is the constraint, not agent capability.

### Customer Service AI Market Opportunity (Bain & Company 2025)

- **$525B global BPO market** with 158,000 addressable companies
- **$49.6B AI in customer service TAM by 2033** (34.3% CAGR)
- **Only 25% of contact centers have successfully integrated AI** (75% remain opportunity)
- **Customer service AI fails 4x more than other AI use cases** (governance + decision context becomes critical)

**Helm Implication**: Largest near-term market opportunity is customer service. High failure rate validates Helm's decision governance approach.

### Financial Impact When Done Right (Bain Analysis)

When organizations follow proper implementation lifecycle:

- **300-1200% annual ROI** from customer service AI
- **3-6 month CAC payback period**
- **31% reduction in handling time**
- **22% improvement in first-call resolution**
- **58% reduction in support costs**
- **LTV:CAC ratios of 100-400:1** across segments

**Helm Implication**: These returns require systematic understanding → planning → execution → monitoring. Helm enables the full lifecycle; ad-hoc deployment captures 10-20% of these gains.

### Why High Performers Win (MIT 2024)

MIT research on enterprise AI maturity found: **High performers are 3x more likely to redesign workflows, not just automate tasks**

- Organizations that rush to automation without workflow redesign see minimal impact
- Organizations that systematically redesign processes (Mine → Design → Manage) see 5-7x better outcomes
- Key differentiator: Breaking work into decision units and determining human vs. AI execution

**Helm Implication**: Helm's Mine/Design/Manage framework is literally the workflow redesign methodology that MIT identifies as the differentiator between winners and losers.

### The Governance Urgency (Bain & Regulatory Analysis)

- **August 2, 2026**: EU AI Act fully applicable to high-risk systems
- **7% global revenue penalty** for non-compliance
- **2,000+ expected "death by AI" legal claims** by end of 2026
- **60% of Fortune 100** appointing Chief AI Officer in 2026 (creating governance demand)

**Helm Implication**: Governance transforms from "nice-to-have" to "existential business requirement" in August 2026. Helm's decision traces and audit capabilities become compliance infrastructure.

### The Learning Gap (McKinsey & MIT)

Current AI agents are largely **stateless**—they don't retain feedback or improve from previous interactions:

- Agents deployed today are isolated transactions, not learning systems
- Organizations cannot explain why agents make decisions
- No feedback loop from decisions → model improvement

**Helm Opportunity**: Helm's persistent decision trace architecture addresses the learning gap by creating precedent libraries that agents learn from—a unique advantage in the market.

## Market POV and Thesis

### The $1 Trillion Productivity Opportunity: The Entry Point

**The Market Context**: Every enterprise is pursuing productivity gains through AI. The opportunity is massive—some estimate a $1T market for productivity tools and services across industries.

**The Insight**: To drive productivity gains, you must first **understand how work is done today**. Without understanding, you can't envision how to do it tomorrow. Without envisioning, you can't execute the transition.

**The Flow**:

```
Understand Today (Mine) → Envision Tomorrow (Design) → Execute Transition (Manage) = Productivity Gains
```

Companies across customer service, finance, operations, and HR are asking: "How do we use AI to make our teams more productive?" But they're stuck at the first question: "What decisions and processes are we actually running right now?"

**This is where Helm enters**: We provide the building blocks to **Understand → Envision → Execute** the productivity transformation.

- **Understand**: Mine captures how work is actually done (decisions, patterns, exceptions, outcomes)
- **Envision**: Design models the new way work could happen with agents
- **Sell**: Precedents and transparency build consensus for the new way
- **Execute**: Manage ensures the transition happens with governance and control
- **Monitor**: Feedback loop proves the productivity gains are real

Without this systematic approach, companies deploy agents haphazardly and capture only 10-20% of potential productivity gains. With this approach, they capture 5-7x better outcomes.

**The $1T Opportunity**: This isn't just for customer service. Every function that relies on decision-making and knowledge work is pursuing this productivity transformation. Helm provides the foundational layer that makes that transformation possible.

### The Constraint-Based Thesis: Executive Function Lifecycle Is the Missing Layer

**Our Core Insight**: The AI industry has solved the "arms and legs" problem. What's emerging as the critical constraint is **executive function**—the entire lifecycle of understanding current work, planning how agents should operate, selling the plan to stakeholders, executing it, and continuously correcting course.

Without executive function, execution cannot happen—and certainly not to its fullest extent. The 95% failure rate of AI projects isn't about capability. It's about incomplete executive function.

#### The Executive Function Lifecycle

Companies need a **five-stage lifecycle** to successfully deploy agents. Most companies attempt only 1-2 stages, which is why they fail:

**1. UNDERSTAND** (Current State of Work)

- What decisions are being made today?
- How are they being made? (rules, heuristics, human judgment)
- What patterns, exceptions, and edge cases exist?
- What are the decision outcomes and metrics?
- **Without this**: You build agents that automate the wrong decisions or miss critical context

**2. PLAN** (Design Agent Decision-Making)

- What decisions should agents make vs. what should humans decide?
- What policies and constraints should govern agent behavior?
- What context (data, history, precedent) does the agent need?
- How do we measure if the agent is making good decisions?
- **Without this**: You deploy agents with no clear intent or boundaries

**3. SELL** (Build Stakeholder Consensus)

- Do service leaders agree with the plan?
- Do compliance and risk teams understand and approve the governance?
- Are frontline employees bought in or resistant?
- Do executives see the business case?
- **Without this**: Agents fail not because they're broken, but because organization rejects them

**4. EXECUTE** (Deploy & Govern)

- Deploy agents according to the plan
- Monitor that agents follow the decided policies
- Log every decision with full context (why did it decide that?)
- Enforce governance rules (escalation, spending limits, etc.)
- **Without this**: Agents operate in chaos, decisions are unauditable, compliance fails

**5. MONITOR & CORRECT** (Continuous Improvement)

- Are agent decisions matching the intended outcomes?
- Are there patterns in agent failures or deviations?
- What context was missing? What policies need adjustment?
- How do we course-correct in real-time?
- **Build this feedback into next cycle of UNDERSTAND → PLAN → SELL → EXECUTE**
- **Without this**: You repeat the same failures, waste accelerates, the 33% who initially fail never recover

#### Why 95% of AI Projects Fail

The harsh reality: **Most companies skip stages 1-3 and jump straight to execution.**

```
What Companies Try:
❌ UNDERSTAND → ❌ (skip) → ❌ (skip) → EXECUTE → ❌ (can't monitor what you didn't plan)
                            = 95% failure

What Succeeds:
✅ UNDERSTAND → ✅ PLAN → ✅ SELL → ✅ EXECUTE → ✅ MONITOR/CORRECT
                            = Agents that work
```

The evidence:

- **33% of service AI deployments fail** because companies rushed from "we have an agent" to "deploy it" without understanding current decisions or building stakeholder buy-in
- **30% create parallel "AI functions"** because frontline workers reject agents they weren't sold on
- Companies that do the full lifecycle see 5-7x better outcomes (from research we've seen)

#### This Mirrors Software Product Management Evolution

**Software Development Evolution**:

1. **Constraint**: How do we build and deploy code? (solved by CI/CD, testing, deployment automation)
2. **New Constraint**: Who decides WHAT to build and WHY? (solved by product management tooling—Jira, roadmapping)
3. **Realization**: PM wasn't nice-to-have; it was the layer that separated "shipping features" from "shipping products"
4. **Infrastructure**: PM tools became mandatory infrastructure because the constraint wasn't execution—it was _direction_

**AI & Agents Evolution**:

1. **Constraint**: How do we build and deploy agents? (solved by LLMs, agent frameworks, orchestration)
2. **New Constraint**: Who decides HOW agents should decide? What outcomes matter? How do we course-correct? (solved by... not yet solved)
3. **Market Reality**: Companies realize they can't just deploy agents; they need a full executive function lifecycle
4. **Inflection Point**: Executive function will become mandatory infrastructure, just like PM tools are mandatory in software

#### The Constraint Sequence

**In Software Development**: execution → execution quality → execution _direction_

**In Agent-Based Systems**: agent capability → agent reliability → agent _executive function_

### Why This Matters for Helm's Positioning

The glut of AI execution technology (Claude, GPT, open models, agent frameworks) means:

- **Building agents is now table stakes** (arms and legs are solved)
- **Running agents is becoming commoditized** (reliability is table stakes)
- **But the full executive function lifecycle is still unsolved** (this is the real constraint)

Companies can deploy agents. But they can't easily execute the full lifecycle:

| Stage                 | Company's Challenge                                       | Helm's Answer                                                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Understand**        | "How do we map current service decisions?"                | Mine: Capture decision traces from current operations                    |
| **Plan**              | "How do we design agent decision policies?"               | Design: Model and specify decision governance                            |
| **Sell**              | "How do we get stakeholders to trust the plan?"           | Transparency: Show the full decision logic and precedents                |
| **Execute**           | "How do we ensure agents follow the plan?"                | Manage: Enforce policies, log all decisions, audit trails                |
| **Monitor & Correct** | "How do we know if agents are working? How do we fix it?" | Precedent Library: Show what worked before, guide continuous improvement |

**This is where Helm comes in**: We're not building agents (everyone is). We're building the **executive function layer** that enables the full UNDERSTAND → PLAN → SELL → EXECUTE → MONITOR/CORRECT lifecycle.

Without Helm (or something like it), companies attempt 1-2 stages and fail. With Helm, they can execute the full lifecycle—which is why they actually succeed instead of joining the 95% failure rate.

#### The Strategic Principle: Attack the NEXT Constraint, Not the Current One

**The Opportunity Gap**: Most companies solve the current constraint. Winners attack the _next_ constraint before it becomes the bottleneck.

**How This Shows Up in Practice**:

**Mistake: Solving the current constraint**

- Current constraint: "Can we build agents?" → Hundreds of vendors build agents
- Result: Commodity market, race to the bottom, no differentiation
- Companies doing this: Every foundation model provider, agent framework, LLM fine-tuning company

**Opportunity: Attacking the next constraint**

- Next constraint: "Can we successfully deploy and manage agents?" → Very few vendors
- Result: Market leadership, defensible positioning, high margins
- Companies doing this: Helm

**The Pattern Repeats Across Ecosystems**:

1. **Email (1990s)**
   - Current constraint: "Can we send digital messages?" → Sendmail, Exchange commoditized
   - Next constraint: "How do we organize, search, prioritize messages?" → Gmail captured the value

2. **Software Development (2000s-2010s)**
   - Current constraint: "Can we write and deploy code?" → Solved by version control, CI/CD
   - Next constraint: "What should we build and why?" → Jira, product management tools captured the value

3. **Cloud Infrastructure (2010s-2020s)**
   - Current constraint: "Can we provision compute?" → AWS commoditized
   - Next constraint: "How do we optimize costs and manage complexity?" → Tools like Datadog, PagerDuty, cost optimization platforms captured the value

4. **AI Agents (2025-2026)**
   - Current constraint: "Can we build agents?" → Claude, GPT, open models commoditized
   - Next constraint: "How do we successfully manage and deploy agents?" → This is where Helm wins
   - Future constraint (2027+): "How do we coordinate and orchestrate agents at scale?" (someone else will own this)

**Why Constraint-Hunting Wins**:

1. **Timing**: You enter before the market realizes it's a constraint
2. **Defensibility**: You're solving something nobody else is focused on yet
3. **Margins**: No competitor yet, so no race to bottom
4. **First-Mover Category**: You define the category before anyone else claims it
5. **Network Effects**: Constraint-solvers accumulate data/insights that competitors can't replicate

**The Competitive Trap**:
Companies making agents are competing in a market that will be commoditized. We're competing in a market that's emerging. Their margin is declining. Ours is expanding.

**Strategic Implication for Helm's Roadmap**:

This principle should guide what we build:

- ✅ **Build**: Things that solve the executive function lifecycle constraint (Understand → Plan → Sell → Execute → Monitor/Correct)
- ❌ **Don't build**: Better agents, faster models, new LLM capabilities (others are doing this, we'd lose in commodity market)
- 👁️ **Watch**: What's the constraint AFTER executive function becomes solved? (Likely: agent orchestration and coordination at scale)

## The Emerging Category

### What Companies Are Calling It

The emerging category sits between human intent and software execution. It captures **"Decision Traces"**—living records of inputs, logic, exceptions, approvals, and outcomes. Multiple industry voices describe this same concept:

**VC Terminology** (Innovation Angle):

- **Ed Sim (Boldstart)**: "Execution Intelligence Layer"
  - Thesis: Agents need "specs" (boundaries/rules) + execution path recording
  - Value: Separates the "specification of intent" from "reliable execution"

- **Foundation Capital**: "Context Graphs"
  - Thesis: 2026 is "$Trillion Dollar Opportunity" to store organizational context
  - Key Insight: "Systems of Decision" will replace "Systems of Record" as central to enterprise
  - Value: Graph connects people, policies, history, and decisions—making "why" searchable

**Analyst Terminology** (Governance Angle):

- **Forrester**: "Agent Control Plane"
  - Positioning: 3-plane architecture—Build Plane (agents) → Orchestration Plane (work) → Control Plane (governance)
  - Key Focus: You cannot trust agents to police themselves; need external governance layer

- **Gartner**: "Decision Intelligence"
  - Definition: The engineering discipline of how decisions are made
  - Approach: "Composite AI" combining LLMs (probabilistic) with knowledge graphs + rules (symbolic) for safety

### The Core Problem Being Solved

Traditional enterprise systems are **state machines**: they record what happened.

```
Example: Ticket #123 is closed. Invoice #456 was paid.
Missing: Why was it closed without resolution? Why was invoice paid despite budget overrun?
```

AI agents need **context machines**: they need access to the reasoning behind decisions.

```
Complete Picture: Ticket closed because customer stopped responding. Invoice paid because VP authorized exception via Slack message + cost-benefit analysis.
This is what agents need to replicate human judgment.
```

### Why This Category Is Emerging in 2026

1. **Arms & Legs Are Solved**: Abundant AI execution technology (Claude, GPT, open models) means building agents is now table stakes
2. **Management Becomes the Constraint**: With agents deployed at scale, the bottleneck shifts to **who decides HOW agents should decide?** → This is executive function
3. **33% Deployment Failure Rate**: Companies are deploying agents without management infrastructure; 33% fail because there's no decision governance
4. **Governance Urgency**: 60% of Fortune 100 appointing Chief AI Officer; they need tools to manage agent behavior
5. **Regulatory Reality**: EU AI Act requires "meaningful human review" and transparent decision lineage (Prediction #41)
6. **Moat Shift**: Companies realize competitive advantage isn't in having agents; it's in the decision data that governs agents
7. **Ecosystem Convergence**: VCs, analysts, and tech leaders all converging on same problem—the missing executive function layer

#### The ROI Crisis: Forrester's 2026 Reality Check

**Critical Market Signal** (Forrester, Q1 2026):

- **25% of planned AI spending will defer to 2027** as CFOs demand concrete ROI justification
- **Fewer than one-third of decision-makers can "tie the value of AI to their organization's financial growth"**
- Companies are deploying agents but can't prove productivity gains

**Why This Validates Helm's Positioning**:

- Companies deploying agents haphazardly (without understanding current decisions, planning the transition, building stakeholder buy-in) cannot measure ROI
- This is exactly the executive function gap Helm solves: systematic UNDERSTAND → PLAN → SELL → EXECUTE → MONITOR approach enables measurable ROI
- 25% spending deferral creates urgency: companies need to fix failed deployments NOW before Q2-Q3 ROI reviews
- The companies that _will_ capture ROI are the ones executing the full lifecycle (the ones with Helm's infrastructure)

## Positioning: Executive Agent for Service Leaders

### Strategic Choice: "Executive Agent for Service Leaders"

**Primary Positioning**: Helm is the **Executive Agent for Service Leaders**—providing the executive function layer that enables systematic understanding, planning, execution, and continuous improvement of agent deployment.

**Why This Positioning Wins**:

1. **Market-Friendly Language**: "Executive Agent" is intuitive to buyers and will become the dominant category language as the market matures
2. **Vertical Specialization**: Starting with service leaders (executives) who have the highest decision complexity and ROI from automation
3. **Expansion Path**: Everyone will eventually have personal agents (Workforce agents, Finance agents, Operations agents). Helm is establishing the category with the highest-value segment
4. **Technical Credibility**: Underpinned by Decision Intelligence infrastructure (decision traces, governance, policy enforcement, continuous learning)
5. **Investor Appeal**: Category ownership before competitors crystallize around "Agent Management," "AI Management," or other terminology
6. **Regulatory Advantage**: Decision Intelligence infrastructure satisfies governance and audit requirements (EU AI Act, compliance audits)

## Why Decision Intelligence for Customer Service Wins

### 1. Analyst Category Alignment

Gartner has established **"Decision Intelligence"** as formal category in 2025 Hype Cycle for AI:

> "Decision Intelligence is the engineering discipline of how decisions are made. It bridges the gap between **Data** (insight) and **Agents** (action) by formalizing the logic, rules, and context required for reliable autonomy."

Forrester has defined **"Agent Control Plane"** as the governance layer that sits above agents:

> "The Control Plane enforces policies, audits decisions, records decision traces, and provides the 'why' that enables safe autonomy."

**Helm's Win**: Being the first to claim "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service" enables:

- Analyst briefings ("this is a new vendor category")
- Research coverage ("Decision Intelligence market growth")
- Gartner Magic Quadrant inclusion (if such quadrant emerges)
- Thought leadership positioning

### 2. Vertical Specialization Advantage

Ed Sim's research (#479) proves: **Vertical specialists win; horizontal infrastructure plays lose**

Key insight:

> "Building middleware layers proves incredibly hard. Incumbent SaaS providers will dominate by integrating agent capabilities. Large LLM companies will dominate by bundling orchestration. **Implication: Pure-play infrastructure plays face headwinds unless they're deeply specialized.**"

**Helm's Win**:

- Specializing in "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service" means:
  - Deep domain expertise in service decisions (routing, escalation, precedent, cost-quality tradeoffs)
  - Turnkey integrations with service platforms (Salesforce, Zendesk, etc.)
  - Defensible moat from service decision data
- Generic "Decision Intelligence Platform" would lose to horizontal incumbents

### 3. Regulatory Tailwind

EU AI Act (August 2, 2026 effective date) requires:

- "Meaningful human review" for high-risk AI
- Transparent decision lineage and audit trails
- Risk impact assessments

**Helm's Win**: Decision traces + governance = native compliance infrastructure

- Every decision captured and auditable
- Human review points enforced
- Regulatory liability reduced

This becomes a **compliance asset**, not an afterthought.

### 4. Product/Market Fit

Helm's architecture (Mine/Design/Manage) naturally maps to Decision Intelligence:

| Helm Module | Maps To                     | Creates                                                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mine**    | Decision Trace Capture      | Records of how decisions were made (inputs, logic, exceptions)   |
| **Design**  | Decision Policy Modeling    | Formal specifications of decision rules and governance           |
| **Manage**  | Decision Governance & Audit | Enforcement, monitoring, and audit of agent decisions            |
| **Output**  | Decision Precedent Library  | Searchable library of decision examples for agents to learn from |

**Result**: Mine/Design/Manage isn't just a product; it's a complete Decision Intelligence workflow. Competitors would need to build similar architecture to compete.

### 5. Network Effects & Moat

Foundation Capital's insight: **Decision trace data becomes competitive advantage**

```
More Customers → More Decision Examples →
Better Precedent Library → Better Recommendations →
Stronger Competitive Advantage → More Customers
```

**Helm's Win**:

- Each customer's decision traces improve Helm's ability to make recommendations
- Over time, accumulated decision data becomes proprietary advantage
- Competitors starting today would take years to catch up
- Classic network effects moat (harder to copy than agents themselves)

### 6. Investor Messaging Clarity

Compare these pitches to VCs:

**Current ("Command Center" positioning)**:
"Helm is an executive command center that gives service leaders insights to optimize operations."

- ❓ What does this mean for AI agents?
- ❓ How is this different from Salesforce dashboards?
- ❓ What's the defensibility?

**Decision Intelligence positioning**:
"Helm captures organizational decision traces—the 'why' behind how service decisions are made. This enables safe agent autonomy while creating defensible network effects moat. As 40% of enterprise apps get AI agents in 2026, Helm provides the infrastructure layer that makes them work."

- ✅ Clear value prop for agent economy
- ✅ Infrastructure positioning (defensible)
- ✅ Network effects story
- ✅ Category alignment (VCs recognize DI language)

## Market Predictions Supporting Helm

### Prediction #1: AI Agents Will Explode, But Governance Is Uncertain

**Gartner (2025)**: 40% of enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents by end of 2026 (up from <5% in 2025)
**Gartner (2025)**: 60% of Fortune 100 will appoint head of AI governance in 2026
**McKinsey (2025)**: Decision Intelligence is #1 AI trend in 2026 Hype Cycle
**Forrester (2025)**: Agent Control Planes becoming essential governance layer

**What This Means for Helm**:

- Massive TAM expansion (agents in 40% of apps = billions in annual deals)
- Critical need for agent governance and context (exactly what Helm provides)
- Agent control planes will become real infrastructure (Mine/Design/Manage = control plane)
- Decision Intelligence is not niche—analysts consensus is that it's the dominant trend

**Helm's Narrative**:

> "While 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by 2026, the real question isn't whether agents exist—it's whether they operate with intelligence and governance. Helm is the decision intelligence layer that enables safe, contextualized agent autonomy. And the market has spoken: Decision Intelligence is Gartner's #1 AI trend for 2026."

---

### Prediction #2: Service Quality Will Dip; Companies Will Rush

**Bain & Company (2025)**: 33% of customer service AI deployments fail due to lack of decision governance
**McKinsey (2025)**: 95% of AI projects fail to deliver expected ROI
**MIT (2024)**: 30% of enterprises will create parallel "AI functions" mirroring human roles
**Forrester (2025)**: 25% of planned AI spending will defer to 2027 as CFOs demand ROI justification

**What This Means for Helm**:

- Companies deploying service AI without decision context will fail (and they know it)
- Those that fail will desperately seek solutions to recover (huge market opportunity)
- "AI function" creation = explicit admission that managing AI requires infrastructure, not just deployment
- CFO pressure on ROI means only organizations demonstrating measurable results will get continued funding

**Helm's Narrative**:

> "Most AI service deployments will fail in 2026 because companies mistake 'deploying an agent' for 'managing decisions.' Helm bridges this gap by capturing decision traces—what decisions matter, who makes them, what context is required. And when 33% of deployments fail mid-year, Helm becomes the recovery/remediation solution."

**GTM Implication**: Not just greenfield opportunity, but recovery/remediation market for failed deployments. Organizations stuck with non-performing agents need Helm to understand what went wrong and fix it.

---

### Prediction #3: Domain-Specific Models & Decision Frameworks Will Dominate

**Gartner (2025)**: By 2028, over 50% of GenAI models used by enterprises will be domain-specific
**Stanford HAI (2025)**: Shift from "AI evangelism" to "AI evaluation"—focus on measured productivity gains
**Ed Sim / Boldstart (2025)**: Vertical specialists beat horizontal infrastructure plays; domain depth creates defensible moat
**McKinsey (2025)**: Customer service is the largest vertical AI deployment use case (highest volume, clearest ROI)

**What This Means for Helm**:

- Generic "customer service AI" won't win; domain-specific decision intelligence will
- Helm's customer service specialization aligns with this trend
- Decision data from customer service becomes competitive advantage (network effects moat)
- This validates Ed Sim's vertical specialization thesis—Helm's beachhead in customer service is strategic, not accidental

**Helm's Narrative**:

> "The AI market is bifurcating. Generic models are table stakes. Winners specialize. Helm is decision intelligence **for** customer service—not a generic agent platform. We understand service decisions deeply: routing, escalation, precedent, cost-quality tradeoffs. And as 40% of enterprise apps get agents, the ones with domain-specific decision context will dominate."

---

### Prediction #4: Agentic Workflows Are Becoming Production-Ready

**Axios**: With MCP reducing friction, agentic workflows will move from demos into day-to-day business

**What This Means for Helm**:

- The infrastructure question shifts from "can agents work?" to "how do we manage agent decisions in production?"
- Agents need context to make good decisions; Helm provides that context

**Helm's Narrative**:

> "Agentic workflows are finally production-ready in 2026. But production readiness requires decision intelligence. Helm sits between your customer service agents (human and AI) and your systems, capturing decision context: precedents, policies, outcomes, exceptions."

---

### Prediction #5: New AI Roles Are Emerging

**Solutions Review**: New roles will emerge: AI workflow designers, automation auditors, **AI agent managers/coaches**
**Insight**: Strategic judgment + AI power is most sought-after talent

**What This Means for Helm**:

- Organizations will hire "AI agent managers" whose job is managing AI decisions
- These people need tools to understand agent behavior, debug decisions, set policies

**Helm's Narrative**:

> "30% of enterprises will create parallel 'AI functions' in 2026. Who manages those functions? The AI Agent Manager—a new role that didn't exist in 2024. Helm is built for them. It's their command center for understanding why agents make decisions, setting policies, debugging failures."

---

### Prediction #6: Transparency & Trust Are Non-Negotiable

**Solutions Review**: AI systems without transparent lineage and measurable trust signals will be too risky to deploy
**PwC**: Enterprise AI Strategy Centralization with top-down governance

**What This Means for Helm**:

- Risk aversion will drive demand for "explainable AI" infrastructure
- Helm's decision traces and context graphs directly address this need

**Helm's Narrative**:

> "Transparency isn't nice-to-have in 2026—it's mandatory. Helm captures the full decision lineage: inputs, logic, exceptions, outcomes. You don't just deploy agents; you audit them. You don't just trust recommendations; you understand why they were made."

---

### Prediction #7: Regulations Are Tightening

**Morrison Foerster**: EU AI Act fully applicable August 2, 2026 (risk-based obligations)
**US Trend**: State-level AI laws multiplying (child safety, impact assessments, meaningful human review)

**What This Means for Helm**:

- Customer service AI needs regulatory guardrails
- Helm's decision traces and governance features become **compliance infrastructure**
- Companies that can demonstrate "meaningful human review" win with regulators

**Helm's Narrative**:

> "Regulatory pressure intensifies in 2026. EU AI Act takes full effect. Helm isn't just operational; it's compliance infrastructure. Every decision trace is auditable. Every agent action has human context."

---

## Strategic Narrative Architecture

### For Investors (Productivity + Constraint Angle)

**Headline**: "Helm: The $1T Productivity Opportunity Platform—Capturing Executive Function as the Constraint"

**The Productivity Thesis**:

- **The Market**: Every enterprise pursues productivity gains. $1T+ opportunity across all functions (customer service, finance, operations, HR)
- **The Blocker**: To achieve productivity gains, companies must understand how work is done today. Most can't answer: "What decisions are we making? How? What context matters?"
- **Helm's Entry Point**: Mine provides the understanding required to envision and execute productivity transformations
- **The Productivity Flow**: Understand Today (Mine) → Envision Tomorrow (Design) → Execute Transition (Manage) = Productivity Gains

**The Constraint Thesis**:

- **The Market Reality**: 95% of AI projects fail, not because agents aren't smart, but because companies skip the executive function lifecycle
- **The Evidence**: 40% of enterprise apps will have agents by 2026. But 33% will fail because companies jump straight from "we have an agent" to "deploy it" without understanding current decisions or building stakeholder buy-in
- **The Constraint**: AI execution (building agents) is now table stakes. The real bottleneck is: Who decides HOW agents should decide? What outcomes matter? How do we course-correct?
- **Helm's Position**: We don't build agents (everyone is). We provide the executive function layer that enables understanding → envisioning → executing productivity transformation

**The Economics**:

- **The Analogy**: Just as product management tools (Jira, Asana) became mandatory infrastructure when PM became the constraint in software, executive function platforms will become mandatory as agent deployment becomes the constraint
- **Defensible Moat**: Decision trace data becomes competitive advantage—more customers = better precedent library = stronger recommendations = network effects moat
- **Immediate TAM**: Every company pursuing productivity gains needs this. $1T productivity opportunity = billions in Helm's addressable market
- **Expansion Path**: Starting in customer service (largest AI deployment use case), can expand to finance, operations, HR—each is a $100B+ market
- **Regulatory Tailwind**: EU AI Act requires "meaningful human review" and transparent decision lineage—Helm's governance is native compliance
- **Analyst Alignment**: First to claim "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service" category; can own "Decision Intelligence" across verticals

**Investor Takeaway**: 2026 is when productivity through AI becomes mainstream—and the failure crisis becomes visible. Companies pursuing the $1T productivity opportunity will realize you can't skip understanding-today and succeed. Those that execute the full Understand → Envision → Execute lifecycle win 5-7x better productivity outcomes. Helm provides the foundational infrastructure that separates winners from those wasting 90% of their productivity opportunity.

---

### For Service Leaders (Productivity Gains + Execution Angle)

**Headline**: "Helm: Unlock Your Service Team's Productivity—Understand Today, Transform Tomorrow, Prove the Results"

**Key Points**:

**The Opportunity**:

- You want to drive productivity gains through AI agents (everyone does)
- But you can't measure or envision the gains without understanding your current operations
- Helm starts with understanding: "What decisions are we making? How? What's working? What's broken?"

**The Execution Path**:

1. **Understand** (Mine): Capture how your team actually makes decisions today—patterns, exceptions, outcomes
2. **Plan** (Design): Model how agents could handle routine decisions, what needs human judgment
3. **Sell** (Transparency): Show your team the plan with precedents and logic so they're bought in
4. **Execute** (Manage): Deploy agents with guardrails, governance, full audit trails
5. **Prove** (Monitor): Track real productivity gains—CSAT improvement, AHT reduction, cost-per-contact control

**The Business Results**:

- Productivity gains: 5-7x better outcomes than ad-hoc agent deployment
- Compliance: Every decision is auditable and explainable (meets regulatory requirements)
- Confidence: You understand why agents make decisions; you can course-correct
- ROI Proof: Clear metrics on CSAT, AHT, cost-per-contact, team satisfaction

**Why It Works**:

- Most teams deploy agents and capture only 10-20% of potential gains because they skip understanding
- Teams that understand their current operations first unlock 5-7x better productivity gains
- Helm makes this systematic and measurable

**Buyer Takeaway**: "I don't just want to deploy AI. I want to drive real productivity gains—which means understanding my current operations, planning the transition carefully, getting my team bought in, executing with control, and proving the results. Helm is the platform that makes that possible."

---

### For Analysts/Industry (Category Definition Angle)

**Headline**: "Decision Intelligence: The Infrastructure Layer for Agent Economy"

**Key Points**:

- 2026 marks inflection from "agent adoption" to "agent maturity"
- Maturity requires infrastructure: decision traces, context graphs, governance
- Helm pioneering "Decision Intelligence" category in customer service vertical
- Mirrors how databases became infrastructure for data-driven software
- **Analyst Implication**: Track which vendors own "Decision Intelligence" in their vertical

**Analyst Takeaway**: Decision Intelligence is emerging infrastructure category. Helm is first to claim it for customer service. Worth research coverage.

---

## Competitive Landscape & Helm's Advantages

### Incumbent Threat: Salesforce, Microsoft Adding Agent Capabilities

**Prediction**: Incumbents will add agent capabilities

**Helm's Defense**: Incumbents will own agents; Helm will own decision intelligence

- Salesforce agents will exist
- Question: Will they operate with decision intelligence? With context? With governance?
- **That's where Helm wins**

**Analogy**: Microsoft owns Office; but Salesforce owns CRM. Specialized infrastructure wins.

---

### Startup Threat: "AI Agent for Customer Service" Companies

**Threat**: Many agent-focused startups will launch

**Helm's Defense**:

- Many will fail due to deployment complexity (Prediction #34-36)
- Helm is infrastructure for **any** customer service AI, not just one agent platform
- "We don't compete with agents. We provide the infrastructure all agents need."

---

### Helm's Structural Advantages

1. **Orchestration Path Advantage**: Helm sits in real-time decision execution (not after-the-fact via ETL), enabling full context capture

2. **Domain Expertise**: Deep customer service knowledge built into Mine/Design/Manage

3. **Decision Trace Data**: Network effects from captured decision traces become increasingly valuable

4. **First-Mover Category Claim**: Own "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service" before competitors

**Timeline**: After EU AI Act implementation

---

## Why 2026 Is the Critical Window for Helm

### The Confluence: Four Forces Converging

1. **Market Inflection** (Gartner, McKinsey)
   - 40% of enterprise apps getting agents by end of 2026
   - Decision Intelligence becomes #1 trend
   - Organizations moving from "can we deploy agents?" to "how do we manage them?"

2. **Execution Crisis** (McKinsey, Bain, Forrester)
   - 88% using AI, only 6% seeing impact
   - 33% of service AI deployments failing
   - 90% of use cases stuck in pilot purgatory
   - Companies desperately seeking solutions

3. **Regulatory Deadline** (Morrison Foerster, EU AI Act)
   - August 2, 2026: EU AI Act fully effective
   - Governance becomes existential requirement
   - Helm's decision traces = native compliance infrastructure

4. **Market Signals** (Analysts, VCs, Industry Leaders)
   - Gartner, Forrester, Foundation Capital all converging on Decision Intelligence as category
   - First-mover advantage: Claim "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service" before competitors
   - 12-18 month window to establish market leadership

### Helm's Unique Position

Helm is positioned to capture this inflection because it solves **three problems no one else is solving**:

1. **Pilot Purgatory** (90% of deployments stuck)
   - Helm's Mine module captures current decisions, enabling visibility into what's broken
   - Design module enables systematic transition planning
   - Result: Companies can move from pilots to production

2. **Learning Gap** (Current agents are stateless)
   - Helm's decision trace architecture creates persistent memory
   - Precedent library enables agents to learn from past decisions
   - Unique advantage: Agents improve over time vs. isolated transactions

3. **Governance Gap** (Regulatory urgency + 33% failure rate)
   - Helm's Manage module provides governance and audit trails
   - Native compliance infrastructure (not bolt-on)
   - Decision traces satisfy "meaningful human review" requirement

### The Competitive Moat

As more customers deploy Helm:

```
More Customers → More Decision Traces Captured →
Better Precedent Library → Better Agent Recommendations →
Stronger Competitive Advantage → Faster Customer Acquisition
→ Even More Decision Data → Network Effects Moat
```

By Q4 2026, Helm will have accumulated decision trace data from hundreds of customer service organizations—a moat that takes competitors years to replicate.
