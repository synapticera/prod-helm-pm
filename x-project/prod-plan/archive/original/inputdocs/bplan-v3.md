# **EVOLVE: The Complete Business Process Transformation Platform**

## **The Pitch in One Sentence**

EVOLVE is the first end-to-end platform that discovers how your business actually works, designs optimal transformation paths, deploys AI agents autonomously, and continuously improves performance—turning process transformation from a multi-year consulting nightmare into a continuous intelligence system that gets smarter with every customer.

---

## **The Problem**

**Companies face a triple crisis in business transformation:**

1. **The Discovery Gap**: 95% of AI agent initiatives fail because companies don't understand their actual processes well enough to know what to automate
2. **The Execution Gap**: Process mining tools identify problems but provide no actionable path to transformation—leaving executives frozen between insight and action
3. **The Assurance Gap**: Even successful transformations decay over time because there's no system ensuring continuous improvement and learning

**The result:** Companies spend millions on consultants for process discovery, then more millions on system integrations for transformation, then watch their improvements erode because they lack continuous monitoring and optimization.

Traditional approaches fail because:

- **Process mining vendors** (Celonis, UiPath) sell expensive mining technology as the product itself—static reports with no transformation execution, priced for enterprise-only ($100K-500K per deployment)
- **Task mining tools** require specialized sensors, expensive integrations, and raise massive security concerns with desktop monitoring
- **RPA platforms** need perfect process definitions upfront and break with any change
- **Custom agent development** takes months with no guarantee of ROI
- **Management consulting** produces PowerPoint decks, not executable solutions

**Most critically:** Business leaders are flying blind. They desperately want to know how their processes compare to peers—not general benchmarks, but specific, detailed insights about what similar companies are doing differently. This intelligence simply doesn't exist in the market today.

## **Why This Matters Now**

### **The Tesla Parallel: Our Strategic Advantage**

Traditional task mining is like old-school self-driving cars: expensive LIDAR sensors, limited adoption, isolated learning. Each installation is a separate project with no shared intelligence.

**EVOLVE replicates Tesla's winning formula:**

**1. Commodity Components**

- Uses standard LLMs and vision AI instead of specialized sensors
- Edge-first architecture pushes compute to user devices
- Massively lowers deployment costs and solves security concerns
- Makes enterprise-grade capabilities accessible to SMBs, not just enterprises

**2. Fleet Learning Model**

- Just as Tesla's millions of vehicles make their autopilot smarter every day, EVOLVE's user base creates compounding intelligence advantages
- Every workflow captured (anonymously) improves recommendations for everyone
- Edge processing preserves privacy while contributing to aggregate intelligence
- More users = better benchmarks = smarter recommendations = better outcomes = more users

**3. Freemium Adoption Model**

- Discovery and mining are FREE—not the product, but the on-ramp
- Build massive user base contributing workflow intelligence
- Monetize transformation execution and continuous improvement
- Land-and-expand built into the product experience

### **The Insight Advantage: What Leaders Desperately Need**

Business leaders are starving for competitive intelligence:

- "How do my peers in similar companies handle this process?"
- "Am I overstaffed or understaffed compared to industry norms?"
- "What's the best-practice workflow for this scenario?"
- "Where should I focus my transformation efforts for maximum ROI?"

**EVOLVE provides the answers no one else can:** With thousands of users across industries, we can show you exactly how your processes compare to peers—not vague benchmarks, but specific, actionable insights mapped to your actual workflows. This intelligence becomes more valuable as our user base grows.

## **Market Opportunity: A Two-Sided Value Proposition**

### **Market Sizing Methodology**

The EVOLVE opportunity spans two distinct but complementary value pools:

**1. Technology Spend (Software Displacement)**
**2. Labor Cost Savings (Human Work Automation)**

We must size both to understand the true market potential.

### **Approach 1: Technology Spend Market (Top-Down)**

**Total Addressable Market (TAM): $127B by 2030**

This represents the converging technology budgets we're targeting:

- **AI Agents Market**: $68B
  - Gartner projects AI agent platforms reaching $68B by 2030
  - CAGR: 35%
  - Source: Gartner AI & ML Market Forecast 2024

- **Process Mining Market**: $23B
  - Process mining and discovery tools
  - CAGR: 33%
  - Source: MarketsandMarkets Process Mining Report 2024

- **RPA Market**: $36B
  - Robotic Process Automation spending
  - CAGR: 27%
  - Source: Grand View Research RPA Market Analysis 2024

**Combined TAM: $127B** (technologies we disrupt or complement)

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): $31B**

Filtering for our realistic reach:

**Geographic Filter:**

- US, UK, EU markets (75% of global spend)
- $127B × 0.75 = $95B

**Company Size Filter:**

- Target: 100-10,000 employees
- These represent 60% of technology spend in this category
- $95B × 0.60 = $57B

**Role/Department Filter:**

- Focus on high-volume, repetitive functions
- Sales Ops, Customer Support, Finance Ops, IT Service Mgmt, HR Ops
- These functions represent 55% of automation spend
- $57B × 0.55 = $31B

**Our SAM: $31B** (realistic technology market we can capture)

### **Approach 2: Labor Cost Savings (Bottom-Up)**

**This is where the real value lies.** Businesses don't buy software for its own sake—they buy outcomes. The primary outcome is reducing labor costs while improving quality and speed.

**Target Worker Population:**

**Global Knowledge Workers in Automatable Roles:**

- Total global knowledge workers: 1.25 billion (ILO data)
- In repetitive, process-oriented roles: 25%
- **Automatable knowledge workers: 312M globally**

**Filtered for Our Market:**

- US/UK/EU markets: 120M workers (38% of global)
- In companies 100-10,000 employees: 48M workers (40% of regional)
- In target roles (Sales Ops, Support, Finance, IT, HR): **29M workers**

**Value Calculation Per Worker:**

Each knowledge worker we help automate creates measurable value:

- **Average fully-loaded cost per knowledge worker**: $85,000/year
  - Base salary: $60,000
  - Benefits, taxes, overhead: $25,000
  - Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics + standard burden rates

- **EVOLVE automation potential**: 40% of work hours
  - Discovery identifies automatable tasks
  - Agents handle 30-50% of repetitive work
  - Conservative estimate: 40% time savings

- **Value created per worker**: $34,000/year
  - $85,000 × 40% = $34,000 in labor cost savings or redeployment

- **EVOLVE capture rate**: 10% of value created
  - Conservative SaaS pricing: capture 10% of value delivered
  - **Revenue per worker automated**: $3,400/year

**Bottom-Up TAM Validation:**

- 29M target workers × $3,400 revenue per worker
- **Bottom-up TAM: $98.6B annually**

**This validates our top-down TAM of $127B** ✓

The technology spend TAM ($127B) actually understates the opportunity because it doesn't fully account for the labor displacement value. Companies will pay us a fraction of the human labor savings we create.

### **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $300M ARR by Year 5**

**Our Realistic 5-Year Target:**

Starting from $0.5M ARR in Year 1, reaching $300M ARR by Year 5 represents:

- **~1% of SAM** (conservative for category leader)
- **~0.3% of bottom-up TAM** (extremely conservative)
- **88,000 workers automated** (assuming $3,400 average revenue per worker)

**Why This Is Achievable:**

With our freemium model and SMB-first approach:

- Year 1: 10,000 free users → 500 paid users → $0.5M ARR
- Year 2: 50,000 free users → 5,000 paid users → $5M ARR
- Year 3: 200,000 free users → 20,000 paid users → $20M ARR
- Year 4: 500,000 free users → 50,000 paid users → $100M ARR
- Year 5: 1M free users → 100,000 paid users → $300M ARR

### **Market Segmentation by Company Size**

**Our Target Segments (100-10,000 employees):**

| Segment        | Employee Range | # Companies (US) | Avg Workers per Company | Total Target Workers |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| **SMB**        | 100-500        | 150,000          | 250                     | 37.5M                |
| **Mid-Market** | 500-2,000      | 35,000           | 1,000                   | 35M                  |

| **Total**      | 100-10,000     | 193,000          | -                       | 108.5M               |

**Filtered for Target Roles (Sales, Support, Finance, IT, HR):**

- Target roles represent 27% of total workforce
- **29M workers in our addressable segments**

**Why This Segmentation Matters:**

**SMB (100-500 employees) - Our Entry Point:**

- 150,000 companies in US alone
- Lower compliance friction (faster sales cycles)
- High need for cost efficiency
- Traditional vendors ignore this segment (too expensive to serve)
- **Our advantage**: Freemium model + edge architecture = viable economics

**Mid-Market (500-2,000 employees) - Expansion:**

- 35,000 companies
- Budget for transformation but need proven ROI
- Will follow SMB adoption curve
- Network effects strongest here (peer comparison value)

**Enterprise (2,000-10,000 employees) - Upmarket:**

- 8,000 companies
- Traditional vendor stronghold
- Will demand our solution once proven in SMB/mid-market
- "Why can't we use this if it works for smaller companies?"
- Highest revenue per customer ($500K-$5M+)

**Revenue Potential by Segment (at scale):**

| Segment    | Companies | Penetration | Avg ARR | Revenue Potential |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| SMB        | 150,000   | 5%          | $25K    | $187.5M           |
| Mid-Market | 35,000    | 8%          | $150K   | $420M             |
| Enterprise | 8,000     | 3%          | $1.5M   | $360M             |
| **Total**  | 193,000   | -           | -       | **$967.5M**       |

Our $300M Year 5 target = 31% of this potential (highly achievable)

## **Why This Matters Now**

### **Market Timing**

- **Agent economy emerging** but companies lack infrastructure to participate
- **Process intelligence democratizing** through commodity AI components
- **Freemium SaaS models proven** in adjacent categories (Slack, Figma, Notion)
- **Edge AI becoming viable** with improved local LLM performance
- **SMB digital transformation accelerating** post-pandemic
- **Economic pressure** driving demand for measurable, rapid ROI

### **The SMB Opportunity**

Traditional process mining vendors focused exclusively on enterprise because:

- High implementation costs required large contracts to be viable
- Complex integrations only made sense for sophisticated buyers
- Sales cycles and support requirements too expensive for SMB

**EVOLVE changes the economics:**

- Edge-first architecture eliminates implementation costs
- Freemium eliminates sales cycle friction
- Self-service reduces support burden
- **Can profitably serve the 150,000 SMBs traditional vendors ignore**

This is classic **low-end disruption**: We start where incumbents can't follow (SMB), prove value, build scale and intelligence, then move upmarket with overwhelming advantages.

## **Competitive Advantage: The Unbeatable Moat**

### **We're Playing a Different Game**

| Dimension         | Legacy Vendors                  | EVOLVE                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Product**       | Mining technology (expensive)   | Mining is free, monetize transformation  |
| **Market Entry**  | Enterprise-only                 | SMB-first, then upmarket                 |
| **Distribution**  | Enterprise sales ($200K+ deals) | Freemium product-led growth              |
| **Data Strategy** | Siloed per customer             | Aggregate learning across users          |
| **Intelligence**  | Static analysis                 | Continuous improvement from fleet        |
| **Architecture**  | Cloud-based (security concerns) | Edge-first (privacy-preserving)          |
| **Benchmarking**  | Generic industry reports        | Specific peer comparisons from real data |
| **Economics**     | High CAC, slow growth           | Viral adoption, rapid scaling            |
| **Moat**          | Technology (commoditizing)      | Data + Network effects (compounding)     |

### **Why Competitors Can't Catch Up**

**Process Mining Vendors** (Celonis, UiPath Process Mining, SAP Signavio):

- Business model requires $100K-500K average deal size
- Enterprise sales org can't economically serve SMB
- Siloed customer data means no cross-company learning
- Discovery-focused with weak transformation execution
- No continuous improvement learning loops
- **Can't build network effects without destroying existing revenue model**

**Task Mining Vendors** (Soroco, Kryon, ProcessGold):

- Expensive specialized sensors limit adoption
- Cloud-based architecture raises security barriers
- Static analysis with no aggregate intelligence
- No agent authoring or deployment capabilities
- **Can't pivot to freemium without destroying existing revenue**

**RPA Platforms** (UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism):

- Already committed to RPA-first approach
- Require perfect process definition upfront
- No discovery or design capabilities
- **Wrong architectural foundation for agent economy**

**Agent Development Platforms** (LangChain, CrewAI, Salesforce AgentForce):

- Assume you know what agents to build
- Developer tools, not business user platforms
- No process discovery or mining capabilities
- No industry benchmarking or peer comparison
- **Starting from wrong end of the problem**

**Management Consulting** (McKinsey, Bain, BCG):

- Human-delivered, not scalable
- No network effects or compounding intelligence
- Extremely expensive, enterprise-only
- **Fundamentally incompatible business model**

### **EVOLVE's Compounding Moat**

**1. Technology Moat (Defensible but commoditizing):**

- Edge-first LLM architecture for privacy-preserving discovery
- Multi-layer intelligence across four transformation phases
- Shadow mode validation system
- Process digital twin technology

**2. Data Moat (Compounding over time):**

- **Workflow Intelligence**: Millions of observed workflows across industries and roles
- **Pattern Recognition**: Machine learning models trained on aggregate business processes
- **Success Metrics**: Real-world data on which transformations work and which don't
- **Industry Benchmarks**: Peer comparison data that doesn't exist anywhere else

**3. Network Effects (Winner-takes-most):**

- **More users** → More workflow data → Better recommendations & benchmarks
- **Better recommendations** → Higher success rates → More word-of-mouth
- **More deployments** → More learning → Smarter agents
- **Cross-pollination**: Insights from one industry benefit adjacent industries

**4. Business Model Moat (Structural advantage):**

- Freemium motion creates 10-100x more users than competitors
- Free discovery eliminates adoption friction
- SMB-first means we build scale where others can't compete
- Aggregate intelligence creates switching costs
- Competitors trapped in legacy pricing and go-to-market models

**The result:** A data flywheel that accelerates while competitors stand still. Every new user makes us stronger, and the gap widens every day.

- **Result**: Larger revenue opportunity + stronger moat + premium valuation

### **The Unique Investment Thesis**

**This is not a "better process mining" investment.**

**This is a low-end disruption + network effects platform play:**

- Start where incumbents can't compete (SMB)
- Build massive user base with freemium economics
- Create compounding data moat from aggregate intelligence
- Provide peer insights no one else can (benchmarking advantage)
- Move upmarket with overwhelming competitive advantages
- Dominate category through winner-takes-most dynamics

**The opportunity:**

- The SMB process intelligence market doesn't exist (created by us)
- The peer benchmarking data doesn't exist (created by our network)
- The work automation network doesn't exist yet (we're building it)
- Whoever builds it first owns the category

---

## **The Ask**

**We're raising $2-3M in seed extension funding to execute the SMB disruption playbook and build unassailable market position.**

This capital will enable us to:

- Build and scale the edge-first mining platform optimized for SMB

- Launch paid tiers and achieve $1.5M MRR
- Position for strong Series A ($6M+ ARR, clear path to $50M ARR)

**Why invest now:**

**Timing**: Window to build SMB user base before competitors understand the model

**Market**: $127B technology TAM + $98B labor savings TAM, but we're starting where nobody else can compete

**Disruption**: Classic low-end disruption playbook proven by Atlassian, Zoom, Shopify

**Network Effects**: True winner-takes-most dynamics through aggregate intelligence and peer benchmarking

**Business Model**: Proven freemium playbook + structural cost advantages + SMB economics

**Team**: Technical depth in edge AI, aggregate intelligence systems, and SMB go-to-market

**Traction**: Clear 18-month path to Series A with measurable milestones by segment

**The opportunity:** Just as Tesla built a fleet that made every car smarter, and Waze built a network that made every driver smarter, we're building a network that makes every business transformation more successful.

Every company—from 100-employee SMBs to 10,000-employee enterprises—will need to transform continuously. We're building the platform that makes that possible, starting where the incumbents can't follow, and capturing the peer intelligence that doesn't exist anywhere else.

**We're not disrupting process mining. We're democratizing business transformation and creating a new category: peer-powered process intelligence.**

- Weaknesses: RPA limitations, cloud monitoring, no continuous improvement, no network learning, limited SMB presence
- **Our advantage**: AI agents over RPA, edge processing, SMB first, learning loops, aggregate intelligence

### **Why No One Can Compete in SMB**

**Legacy Vendors Can't Serve SMB:**

- Average deal size: $100K-500K (SMB can't afford)
- Sales model: Enterprise field sales ($50K+ cost per customer)
- Implementation: Requires consultants and integration partners
- Cloud architecture: Security concerns, high compute costs
- **Economics simply don't work at $10K-50K deal sizes**

**Startups Can't Build Network Fast Enough:**

- Network effects require massive scale
- Need years to accumulate workflow intelligence
- First mover advantage in SMB market
- We're building the network now—by the time they try, insurmountable lead

**Tech Giants Could (But Won't):**

- Microsoft, Salesforce, Google could build networks
- But SMB process mining isn't strategic to their core
- Would require dedicated go-to-market and product focus
- Acquisition more likely than build (we're the acquisition target)

### **The Disruption Timeline**

**Year 1: SMB Dominance**

- EVOLVE: 50,000 SMB users, network effects visible, $1-2M ARR
- Competitors: Unaware or dismissive ("SMB isn't our market")

**Year 2: Mid-Market Threat**

- EVOLVE: 200,000 users, mid-market traction, $10-20M ARR, peer benchmarking = killer feature
- Competitors: Beginning to understand threat, attempting SMB plays (failing due to cost structure)

**Year 3: Enterprise Encroachment**

- EVOLVE: 500,000+ users, enterprise wins, $50-100M ARR, category leader
- Competitors: Attempting network strategies (too late, can't change business model), acquisition discussions

**Year 4-5: Category Ownership**

- EVOLVE: 1-2M users, $200-300M ARR, de facto standard for SMB/mid-market, strong enterprise presence
- Competitors: Acquisition or irrelevance

**The result**: EVOLVE becomes the work automation platform across all segments. We own the SMB and mid-market categories entirely, and compete strongly in enterprise with overwhelming advantages from scale, aggregate intelligence, and peer benchmarking capabilities.
