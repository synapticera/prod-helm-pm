foreign [Music] [Music] good morning good afternoon good evening everyone my name is Samson David I'm the CEO of Sirocco many organizations have invested significantly into automation programs there's never been more expectations from automation programs and the scrutiny also in automation programs and their ability to be able to deliver rois and business outcomes has never been higher the key challenge in front of automation programs is not how to automate there are many Technologies out there that you could use RPA you could use IDP you could use chat Bots you could use OCR Technologies there are many Technologies out there but the Holy Grail of automation is to know what to automate and there's no one watch there are many watts what are the manual work patterns within my team what are the different ways my teams are doing the same work what should I eliminate what should I optimize what should I standardize what should I automate what should I not automate and what is my Roi across all of these things organizations fundamentally are looking at getting the answers to the what manually by doing massive Discovery workshops now there are challenges with the discovery workshops right it takes too much time it takes too much time out of business it it is expensive it is opinion based it's not factual database it's a point in time-based this manual exercise it's slow it's not as scalable so organizations really need to have technology to be able to solve this problem and this technology cannot be looking at just log files because log files will just tell you what the system of the record application is doing what you really need is technology which is looking at the Dark Side of the Moon and Illuminating the Dark Side of the Moon how do we light up this Dark Side of the Moon you'll see toss mining you see process mining you see task Discovery you see process Discovery process intelligence hybrid process mining you get process understanding there are a bunch of terms out there but if you digital through all of these things there are really two sources of Truth one you look at log files it'll tell you what your systems are doing then you really need to look at the interaction data set between how people are interacting with software this will illuminate the Dark Side of the Moon there are two fundamental types of Technologies out there right now one is computer-based which what is computer-based division computer-based vision is really you take a bunch of snapshots you stack them up together and then you scrub it to get insights there are three fundamental challenges with this technology number one it doesn't scale number two it doesn't get you as sharp insights as you need and number three is a fundamental privacy issue you can't be taking a picture and say I'm not looking and then scrubbing and submitting it so these are fundamental challenges computer-based vision technology Soco has taken a very different approach to solving this problem of lighting up the Dark Side of the Moon and we call it the Scout work graph Scout Warcraft is very similar to what Google has done with Google Maps exactly in the same way how so the core data set is the interaction data set between users and systems and what we've done with Scout Warcraft is you've taken this and we've mapped every point for every Point we've got the metadata and we've got the relationship across the points and we've got a craft build with millions of loads and millions of edges what can you do with it just like Google number one it will tell you what this what the state is as is what is your as a state number two it'll tell you if you want to go to from point A to point B what does it mean in the context of work it is really when you're kicking off a bunch of tasks or processes it'll tell you hey look there are 18 variations for every variations these are the steps this is how much time it's taking this is the best variant or these are the best variants that you need to do and oh these are the hot spots that you might encounter the third thing that the Scout program can tell you is as you go along as part of the processes it can give near real time insights number one it can tell you hey look this is stuff that you can optimize this is what you could standardize this is a credible automation pipeline that you can build this is how you can automate this is what you will get after you automate this is how you can rationalize your application landscape this is how you can drive technology adoption and a bunch of other things and finally the Scout Warcraft also allows Enterprises to build Rich applications on top of it this is our approach to building the Scout photograph and lighting up the Dark Side of the Moon foreign
