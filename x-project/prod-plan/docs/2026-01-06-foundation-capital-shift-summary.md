# Foundation Capital Thesis: Key Shifts for Helm (One-Pager)

**Date**: January 6, 2026
**Source**: Foundation Capital's "Systems of Agents will collapse the enterprise stack" research
**Action**: Messaging and positioning should shift immediately

## The Foundation Capital Thesis in One Sentence

**"AI Agents will replace all four layers of enterprise software (Records → Engagement → Intelligence → Management) over 5 years, and the winner will be who owns the decision infrastructure layer."**

---

## What Changed (Jan 5 → Jan 6)

| Dimension              | Before (Jan 5)                        | After (Jan 6)                              | Impact                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Market Opportunity** | $2-3B (service governance)            | $4.6T (labor replacement market)           | 1,500x larger TAM                  |
| **Competitive Moat**   | First-mover in executive function     | Decision data compounds indefinitely       | Defensibility changes everything   |
| **Product Focus**      | "Help leaders manage agents"          | "Enable agents to execute autonomously"    | Reframe as infrastructure not tool |
| **Timeline**           | 5-7 year window                       | 2-3 year window (agents disrupting NOW)    | Urgency increases                  |
| **Positioning**        | "Executive Agent for Service Leaders" | "Decision Infrastructure Layer for Agents" | Shift to infrastructure language   |

## Foundation Capital's Three Key Claims

### 1. Agents Disrupt Systems of Intelligence FIRST

- Traditional BI tools (Tableau, Looker) depend on manual data + structured databases
- Agents automatically capture decision context → better insights without dashboards
- **Implication**: Helm shouldn't compete with BI tools; agents make them obsolete

### 2. Decision Context (Context Graphs) = $1T+ Opportunity

- Decision traces (who decided what, why, exceptions, outcomes) are the new competitive asset
- Companies capturing this first build moat that compounds over time
- **Implication**: Helm's Mine module is capturing $1T opportunity, not just "governance"

### 3. Integration Depth = Only Defensible Moat

> "Integration is the product surface. The prize isn't features; it's execution depth."

- Generic "AI management tools" will commoditize
- Vertical specialization + implementation expertise = defensible
- **Implication**: Helm's deep service specialization is structural advantage, not just go-to-market

---

## Helm's Position: Perfect But Unrecognized

**Foundation Capital's World Needs**:

- ✅ Sits in execution path (captures decision data)
- ✅ Builds decision context (context graphs)
- ✅ Vertically specialized (service operations)
- ✅ Implementation-depth focused (Mine → Design → Manage)
- ✅ Fleet learning (decision data improves all customers)

**Helm Provides**: All of the above

**Gap**: We're not **saying** we're building decision infrastructure; we're saying we're "helping service leaders manage agents"

---

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Update Positioning (This Week)

From: **"Executive Agent for Service Leaders"**
To: **"The Decision Infrastructure Layer for Service Agents"**

- Primary message: Capturing decision context at scale
- Secondary message: Making that context valuable through governance + learning
- Outcome: Agents become more autonomous because they have organizational memory

### 2. Update Investor Pitch (This Week)

- Lead with Foundation Capital thesis ($4.6T labor market opportunity)
- Show how Helm captures decision infrastructure first
- Explain why decision data moat is more defensible than feature moats
- Reframe TAM: $2-3B → $4.6T

### 3. Update Product Narrative (Next 2 Weeks)

- Mine: "Capture decision traces as foundation for learning"
- Design: "Formalize decision policies from organizational patterns"
- Manage: "Agents execute within governance framework; continuous improvement"
- Outcome: "Decision library becomes more valuable every month"

### 4. Update Board Narrative (This Week)

- "Enterprise software as we know it is being replaced by agents"
- "Foundation Capital thesis validates our TAM: $4.6T, not $2-3B"
- "Winner will be infrastructure layer; we're perfectly positioned"
- "Timeline accelerated: 3-5 years to category leadership (not 5-7)"

## Why This Matters for Different Stakeholders

### For Investors

**Old Narrative**: "Solving 3-5 year governance problem" (raises $X, sells to Salesforce)
**New Narrative**: "Building decision infrastructure for post-enterprise-software era" (raises $X, becomes $10B+ company)

### For Customers

**Old Narrative**: "Help us manage agents better"
**New Narrative**: "Build our organizational decision memory so agents improve over time"

### For Employees

**Old Narrative**: "Building governance tools"
**New Narrative**: "Building the infrastructure layer for the $4.6T labor automation market"

### For Board

**Old Narrative**: "Executing on executive function opportunity"
**New Narrative**: "Capturing decision infrastructure before competitors recognize it"

---

## Risk: Moving Fast Requires Conviction

**Why This Matters**: If we shift messaging without conviction, it reads as chasing trends

**How to Own It**:

1. Read Foundation Capital's thesis thoroughly (you now have the research)
2. Understand why decision infrastructure is defensible
3. Believe that vertical specialization + integration depth = moat
4. Communicate with confidence that this is structural (not fad positioning)

**If We Do This Right**: We're not chasing a trend; we're recognizing what we're actually building

## One Critical Quote (Use Everywhere)

> "AI has accelerated the collapse of software primitives. The only defensible moat is integration depth and vertical specialization. Decision infrastructure is the next trillion-dollar opportunity."

## Bottom Line

Foundation Capital's research doesn't change what Helm is building.
It changes **how valuable** what Helm is building actually is.

From: Solving a governance problem (TAM: $2-3B, Timeline: 5-7 years)
To: Building decision infrastructure for labor automation (TAM: $4.6T, Timeline: 2-3 years)

Messaging should shift immediately. Product doesn't need to change; just how we describe it.
