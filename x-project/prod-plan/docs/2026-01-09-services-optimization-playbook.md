## Phase 1: Quick Wins (Days 1-30)

### 1.1 Utilization Audit

**Action**: Analyze last 6 months of billable hours by person

| Employee | Billable Hours | Available Hours | Utilization | Target |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Person A | x              | y               | z%          | 75%    |
| ...      | ...            | ...             | ...         | ...    |

**Common Utilization Killers**:

- [ ] Excessive internal meetings
- [ ] Over-scoped proposals (free work)
- [ ] Poor project scheduling (gaps between engagements)
- [ ] Training/certification time not managed
- [ ] Admin burden on senior people

**Quick Fixes**:

- Limit internal meetings to 4 hours/week per person
- Implement "no free work" policy for scope creep
- Create bench utilization program (internal projects that convert to IP)
- Delegate admin to lower-cost resources or automate

### 1.2 Rate Card Review

**Action**: Compare your rates to market

| Role       | Your Rate | Market Rate | Gap | Action     |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | --- | ---------- |
| Architect  | $x        | $200-275    | +/- | Raise/Hold |
| Senior Dev | $x        | $175-225    | +/- | Raise/Hold |
| Admin      | $x        | $125-175    | +/- | Raise/Hold |

**Rate Optimization Tactics**:

- [ ] Raise rates for new engagements by 10-15%
- [ ] Add rate escalation clause for renewals (5%/year)
- [ ] Premium pricing for specialized skills (AI, Data Cloud, MuleSoft)
- [ ] Value-based pricing for fixed-scope projects

### 1.3 SG&A Quick Cuts

**Review each expense category**:

| Category                  | Current | Target     | Savings |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **Software/Tools**        | $x      | Reduce 20% | $y      |
| **Office/Facilities**     | $x      | Reduce 30% | $y      |
| **Travel**                | $x      | Reduce 40% | $y      |
| **Marketing**             | $x      | Reduce 50% | $y      |
| **Professional Services** | $x      | Reduce 30% | $y      |
| **Insurance**             | $x      | Review     | $y      |

**Immediate Actions**:

- [ ] Audit all software subscriptions—cancel unused
- [ ] Shift to remote-first if not already (eliminate/reduce office)
- [ ] Implement travel approval process (video first)
- [ ] Pause marketing spend (not growth-focused)
- [ ] Renegotiate vendor contracts

## Phase 2: Structural Changes (Days 31-60)

### 2.1 Team Structure Optimization

**Current State Analysis**:

| Role               | Count | Fully Loaded Cost | Utilization | Revenue Generated |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Partners/Owners    | x     | $y                | z%          | $a                |
| Senior Consultants | x     | $y                | z%          | $a                |
| Junior Consultants | x     | $y                | z%          | $a                |
| Operations/Admin   | x     | $y                | 0%          | $0                |

**Optimization Questions**:

1. Are there non-billing roles that can be eliminated or combined?
2. Can senior people delegate admin work?
3. Is the partner/consultant ratio optimal?

| **Fixed Scope Projects** | 40-50%         | x%       | 40%        |
| **Managed Services**     | 50-60%         | x%       | 20%        |
| **IP/Accelerators**      | 60-80%         | x%       | 10%        |

**Shift Strategy**:

- Package repeatable work into fixed-scope offerings
- Create managed services for recurring relationships
- Build accelerators/IP from common patterns (and potentially feed to Helm)

### 2.3 Client Portfolio Optimization

**Client Profitability Analysis**:

| Client   | Revenue | Margin | Margin % | Strategic Value |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | --------------- |
| Client A | $x      | $y     | z%       | High/Med/Low    |
| Client B | $x      | $y     | z%       | High/Med/Low    |
| ...      | ...     | ...    | ...      | ...             |

**Actions by Quadrant**:
