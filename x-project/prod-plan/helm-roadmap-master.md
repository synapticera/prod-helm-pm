# HELM Product Roadmap - 2026

> **Strategic Focus:** Depth Before Breadth - Prove the full value chain with Dispatch before scaling

**Last Updated:** February 2, 2026
**Status:** Working Draft
**Primary Design Partner:** Dispatch

---

## Executive Summary

With prototypes complete across all four modules (Explore, Mine, Design, Manage), the focus shifts to market validation. The 90-day priority is proving product-market fit with Dispatch as our active design partner.

### Core Principle

The four modules are sequential - Mine feeds Design feeds Manage. Explore runs as parallel lead generation. We must prove the value chain works before spreading resources thin.

### Key Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Success Criteria |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Dispatch baseline complete | End of Feb | Data extracted, validated, insights delivered |
| PMF validation | End of Mar | Dispatch confirms value; testimonial commitment |
| Second design partner | End of Apr | Signed agreement, engagement started |
| First commercial revenue | End of May | Paid Mine engagement (non-design partner) |
| Market entry | End of Jun | Revenue from all three paid modules |
