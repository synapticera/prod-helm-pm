# Helm x-project Master State

This document is the master reference for the Helm project. It describes what we're building, where we are strategically, key decisions made, and how to navigate the project materials.

## 🎯 What is Helm?

**Helm** is an **Executive Agent Platform for Service Leaders** - the missing executive function layer that separates successful AI deployments from failed ones.

**The Problem We Solve**:

- 95% of AI projects fail or deliver zero ROI
- Companies have plenty of AI "arms and legs" (execution technology) but lack the executive function layer to govern, understand, plan, and measure results
- Service leaders can't answer: "What's my current state? Where should I add agents? How do I ensure it works?"

**Our Solution**:
Helm helps service leaders through the complete AI agent lifecycle:

1. **Understand** - Map current operations and constraints
2. **Plan** - Design agent integration strategy
3. **Sell** - Build internal business cases
4. **Execute** - Deploy with governance and decision tracing
5. **Monitor & Correct** - Measure results and iterate

**Why It Matters**:

- Helm users see 5-7x better outcomes vs 10-20% from ad-hoc deployment
- Decision trace infrastructure creates a competitive moat (more data = better recommendations)
- $1T+ productivity opportunity across enterprise service functions

## 📍 Project State & Key Decisions

### Primary Positioning (Decided)

**"Executive Agent Platform for Service Leaders"**

This replaced earlier candidates:

- Decision Intelligence for Customer Service (too narrow, academic)
- AI Management (too generic)
- Execution Intelligence Layer (too technical)

We chose "Executive Agent" because it:

- Clearly names the category we're creating
- Appeals directly to our primary buyer (Service Leaders)
- Emphasizes the platform nature (not point solution)
- Aligns with market convergence (VC, Gartner, Forrester all recognizing execution/governance as critical)

### Market Inflection: The Constraint Stack

**Key Strategic Insight**: The opportunity isn't solving the current constraint; it's solving the _next_ constraint in the ecosystem.

**Current State (Arms & Legs)**: Market flooded with LLMs, prompt engineering tools, agent frameworks
**Next Constraint**: Executive function layer - governance, decision tracing, outcome measurement
**Our Position**: First-mover in building executive function infrastructure for customer service

### Triple Market Validation

1. **Customer Conversations** - Direct articulated needs from:
   - Mike (VP Service) - needs governance layer
   - Shibohn (Director of AI) - needs understanding/planning capability
   - Colby (Chief Service Officer) - needs execution framework
   - Mark (VP Customer Operations) - needs measurement

2. **Internal Products** - We're experiencing the management constraint ourselves:
   - MAX: needs governance layer for agent proliferation
   - Claude Code: needs decision tracing and outcome tracking
   - This validates the problem is real

3. **VC/Analyst Convergence**:
   - Ed Sim: invested in "Execution Intelligence Layer" thesis
   - Gartner: Decision Intelligence #1 trend for 2026
   - Forrester: Agent Control Planes emerging requirement

## 📊 Key Market Data Points

### McKinsey State of AI 2025 - Critical Findings

**The Core Gap**: 88% of organizations use AI regularly, but only 39% see enterprise-level EBIT impact. This 49-point gap is Helm's core market opportunity.

**Agent Adoption Status**:
| Stage | % of Orgs |
|-------|-----------|
| Scaling agents | 23% |
| Experimenting | 39% |
| Not engaged | 38% |

**High Performer Differentiation**: High performers are **3x more likely** to have:

- Executive leadership actively driving AI adoption
- Scaled agents across most business functions
- Advanced agent use cases deployed

**Critical Success Factor**: McKinsey explicitly states **"Workflow redesign has the biggest effect on EBIT impact"** - this directly validates Helm's Design module positioning. Companies can't just deploy agents; they must redesign how work happens.

**Risk Escalation**: Companies managing 2x more AI-related risks in 2025 vs 2022 (4 vs 2 average). As agents scale, governance becomes critical.

**Helm Alignment**: The 61% of companies NOT seeing enterprise ROI are Helm's addressable market—they can deploy agents but lack infrastructure to redesign workflows and achieve governance at scale.

### Adjacent Market Categories

**Customer Success Platforms** (Forrester Wave Q4 2025):

- Gainsight, Totango, Planhat, ChurnZero
- Focus: Post-sales customer outcomes, retention/expansion
- Emerging sub-category: "Customer Growth Platforms" (Customer-Led Growth)

**Helm Differentiation**: These platforms focus on customer relationship management; Helm focuses on **decision intelligence and agent governance** for customer service operations—complementary but different markets.
