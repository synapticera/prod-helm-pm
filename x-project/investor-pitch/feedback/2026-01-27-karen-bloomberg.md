Study, you know, people put, you know, in how it's not useful and and we all know that there's gonna be a reckoning coming.

So I think it's more about, like, "Hey, here's Delta dental."

Like, they didn't know how to use AI.

And we came in and like, I almost would start out with the story for the most part, and make it concise.

It doesn't have to be like a 10 minute story.

It's like a two minute story of, you know, they didn't know what to do.

Now our person is seen as the luminary in the firm.

We're gonna do that same thing that we did for Delta dental with other customers.

And guess what?

Sales source is selling this for us.

Yeah.

Our vision is salesforce is selling this for us because they need to find a way to make salesforce stay relevant. And stay.

So this whole idea, so, um this whole idea of, and again, I know I didn't love where this was and all and obviously it needs work, right?

But this idea that there's this constraint and that that is a new area, is that like obvious boring or just too macro and too jargony and that it doesn't getuced macro and jargony and consult .

Yeah.

And it's right, but everyone kind of knows, and we just don't know what the bottleneck is.

So you need to tell us what the bottleneck is.

And you can tell us through sharing a story about Delta dental.

Yeah, I got to know, so this is a thousand times more interesting than the funnel. Than the macro.

Okay, gotcha.

Okay.

You know, because Delta dental or whoever, you know, you of other customers, but it's just an example of.

Yeah, no, it's always, it's do you go from the general, but particular, particular to general.

And in the story, you always, the particular to general is more powerful rather than starting necessarily.

And when the two connect, that's when it's nice .

And that's what honestly gets me so excited.

The story is like, I, when I just been thinking about, okay, what's the issue?

And in my bones, I have this, this is this huge problem.

And then having this idea that if I talk about it in the context of this this constraint everyone sees coming , that could be kind of interesting.

And so that's why I've kind of gone to this as the macro.

But I hear you, like, you don't lead with that because it feels like a bunch of stuff.

Well, everyone feels like AI is going to be important.

Yeah.

You know, the interesting thing that you have is an advantage, which could play, well, when you go to fundraises , the models, you know, the the big companies are moving so quickly .

Health data, like, all these different things that no one thought.

I mean, you expected would be on the horizon, but it's literally wiping out companies, like, you know, like.

I mean, I'm surprised certain companies are still around and getting crazy valations, because literally at the pace that open AI is moving on some of these things, they're getting decimated really quickly.

Oh, God, I know, yeah..

And so a lot of investors are sitting here, I hear this.

I mean, it's kind of like, it's gonna be really funny to be.. In the throw of it all, you know, over the next few days, where everyone's feeling a little bit of, you know, talking to them, they're all panic.

Like, how do I?

Where do I best?

Well, the safe place to invest in this whole thing is in some of these areas that are doing what you're doing, you know, because it's like you're making it useful.

You have a domain that open AI's not able to easily just kind of get into, and you have some of the big players, like a sales force that's like trying to figure out how do I stay relevant, what our mind moves in this?

And people like Microsoft haven't been moving fast enough.

Like, he's they started out very quickly, you know, partnering with open AI, and then, uh oh, like, Claw just introduced work, you know?

Like, stuff like that is like, so it could easily happen to Sales Wars, but Sales Force has all this great data.

Yeah.

And so it's gonna be a while before people totally trust .

They have a little bit of a, you know, window, and I think they're trying to make good moves.

So of all the people playing in this area, like sales sources probably in a better position than many of the other kind of companies.

I don't know how you feel about it.

Obviously, you're making a decision on when we play, but I think that's gonna resonate with investors.

I'm hopeful.

Yeah.

But we got to make this story easier for them to follow. 'cause otherwise it sounds like a lot of AI.

Yeah.

Like a consultative AI.

Okay.

Got it.

Yeah, I mean, they can't land as soft like that.

Okay, that's that's really helpful.

And I think and that is, and it's been interesting, the some of the commentary about the East Coast investors in particular beings so panicked.

And it's on two fronts, where one, they're missing it.

And then number two , oh my God, where do I invest that I'm not sitting in front of the steam train?

And I think and by the way, West Coast investors are panicked even more.

It's funny because they can see how quickly things are going, and there are also more chattery than most.

Like, like, I've never seen people like talent just move around so quickly.

It's, like, there's no loyalty, it's like, "Oh, my God, I'm missing out, I gotta, I can't be at this company for a month longer than I need to, because the big thing is taking you know, it's like, all this crazy stuff.

So, I mean, I think, actually, it's kind of funny.

It's not funny.

I mean, it's it's sad, but that's the new world we're living in.

So we just got to make sure you can get the money so you can keep pace with all these things, um, and build.

So, Karen, how do we to that point, and I mean, how do we think about tuneing?

I mean, obviously, we got we can tune this up for your group and they're going to want to, we should treat your group more as a forward lookler.

Somebody the deck and let me at least look through it. , Send it to me and Laurie and Will figure out what's not in there that needs to be in there.

Mm hmm. .

Okay.

And then we can figure out what's the best next step on that.

And how do you think about your process and how should I think about this?

I got to figure out like, what's the what's the what's the story we're telling people?

It seems like this is to raise.

It's not really to get to a million of revenue.

It's to get to some level of customers where there's velocity to the customer.

Well, here's here's another part of it, but again, your group may not want to hear this at all, but it certainly is relevant to ..

I'm sorry, by the way, I'm eating because I didn't..

Oh, no worries.

And we're over time, but I have to do you happen to have another minute are you...

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, it was an internal thing.

And I said, hey, I was supposed to eat while then.

It was them, so I'm just having a chocolate bar.

All right, so this is, so one of the things, and this is more getting into the bowels of how we're going to operate, but we're basically going to take all the existing stuff, right ?

And what we're just referring to is AI solutions, right?

So that's the industry agents, the industry apps, the vibe coding that is, and then some of the other nut consulting, but forward deployed engineers.

That part of it, and just make sure that it's in its own thing and I'm actually sure you going to hire a leader so that I'm not spending as much time on that so I can focus on the innovative thing.

And if I'm an investor, and again, you guys don't want to hear this because you're pure venture investors, but other people like this because, okay, this isn't going to zero, right?

Like, like a software ass that could be.

So we say, great, this and, you know, and there could be some upside here, but this looks more like a traditional ..al.

Yeah, and it's an AI focused one, so we know, it's got some alpha.

It's got some beta, but it's not alpha.

And then and then this is the alpha, right?

Is obviously the new product, the executive agent, defining this new category executive agents who allow us to go and manage and transform faster, right?

So that's the other piece of it.

And that's where the money goes, basically, to drive the proof points here, because this is what we're going to go going to use the learning.

We had from the last year.

There's a business here, so that's going to continue on.

And then this business is what we're really investing in to go open up the aperture.

Yeah, and what I would say on this is.. Totally appreciated.

I skew more East Coast and faster than I do West Coast investor, so..

I don't mind having the... Consulting business that kind of supports The . the integrator business that supports some of the other stuff, at least for the near term.

I do look at the AI product milestones and say, "O million isn't an interesting goal.

Yeah.

But it's it' But like you said, it's not about the revenue.

So maybe I need to get more clear on, because it's really about..

What's that?

What are you really targeting there?

Yeah.

Well, it it's really about , I mean, again, millions is one way to measure that we've got the beginning of product market fit.

You've got really exciting users.

It's a tiny number.

Again, it's these other indicators that are going to show up in the funnel, right?

And if this Fremium model survives, it'll be usage, right?

It'll be usage and journey and like, oh, extrapolation, right?

Kind of classic , that's what I want to see.

I want to see what that, what the KPIs are that you're thinking about for that.

Okay.

Because the challenge now with the AI businesses is they are scaling so quickly.

So a million doesn't look like, a million's always been like, oh, you know, who cares?

Like, I mean, they care, it shows that there's somebody interested, but it doesn't really tell you that the business has been.

Yeah, what we need to do is have an leading indicator that it's gonna go from five to 25 to, you know, set to 100, right?

That's And what is your I want to, I want to see some sort of organic, like, that you figured, you're starting to understand the GTM motion.. In a way that's interesting.

So, you know, you just add water, you know?

Like, I hire the salespeople, I hire the, you know.

Okay.

All , like, that kind of thing.

Right.

Okay.

Yeah.

And certainly in this decor now, it's just, you know, an ugly, anyway, it's that story of that God to market possibility isn't well told.

Okay.

I mean, it's okay, but I just, I think, yeah.

And just for your own way, when you present the stuff, like, if AI product is the important piece, then put that on the top.

Yeah.

You know, like, just always lead with that's the growth .

Okay.

Um, Br, send us the stuff.

We will, you know, be back with any questions.

Okay.

But are you are you gonna need any, should I be planning on talking to your group or you need to digest and come back and share with you?

Yeah, we need to digest and get it into a format that our group's going to , that's going to be receptive.

The one piece that I couldn't see from all the stuff we were doing is, like, so we're raising three.

It gets you 12 to 18 months .

Like, what, what is, how does that look?

Like, how much, what's the expectations that you need of revenue?

Is it 12 to 18 months without any revenue, or is it 12 to month 18 months?

Well, that may be ansring a different question.

So, is it the question you're answering, when do we run out of money?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

So.

Like, what is it?

Because some of this stuff, you know, things move, it takes time, you know, like, yeah, how much do we really have?

Yeah.

Okay.

So I've got a , you'll see an operating model as well that shows kind of what the burn is across the different units.

I'm not even sure I'm looking at the right one right now.

Because I wasn't going to go there here.

But let's just say that, yeah, you need to see the operating view and the cash view , right?

And then a simple way to understand, oh, this is when we run out of cash.

Okay.

And this is a.

Oh, that's where you run out of cash.

Ooh, but it looks like .

So you don't.

This is the argument that says, okay, hold on.

Yeah, so, and again, this leaves a little bit too much work because we have we have a million bucks in the bank, right?

And we're burning, we're going to burn two and a half.

Okay.

2.6 So you have four total coming in between the rays and the existing proceeds, right?

So that leaves you with, you know, nominally a million and a half at the end of the year.

So you still got some gas, some fuel in the tank to go figure out what's next.

You're not out of money yet.

So that's that's the kind of the idea .

But it's not as simple as it could be, as far as telling that story here.

But that that's a story you won't understand.

Like, where do we end up?

Okay, great.

In a year, here's where you get got.

Okay.

So if it goes, you know, better, worse, than you expect, you know, you can Yeah, and you dial up the consulting if you need to, when do you have to do that?

Like, Anyway, I just want to make sure that you really have enough runway to start to get channels take time, as you know.

I know, I know, I know.

Yeah, if we're trying to accomplish a lot in a year.

Yeah.

I totally understood.

Yeah, I think that being said, , you know, raising, you know, it feels like the right amount of money where we can go, we can move fast, and we can go get further down the road and, you know, things you don't I think you have to do.

I think there's some interesting anecdotes and pipeline build that could start to happen, that would make this look really interesting.

We do need to make the story easier for people to digest and understand.

Sure.

You know, but some of that's going to come as you get more of these customers, because then you can just feature a few case studies and say, "Hey, the common theme is this."

Yeah, actually, the story for me gets better when I'm forced to present it to someone who doesn't understand it.

Then it's like, "Oh, okay, let me really walk in their shoes.

But yeah, the , I think and that's honestly a little bit of the in and the yang here, which is, and this is where Justin is like, why would we go do this little race, right?

No, like, just go play big.

Just tell tell the story.

Right?

And , and I think, and that's really where I want to be.

I just, I just don't feel like I've got enough right now to.

No, I think you just have to be a different type of storyteller.

If you want to be.

No, I mean, you could go.

You could go.

I don't know Justin's contacts, but if he thinks he could and he has people to be interested, I mean, I wouldn't shy away from that, but ..

Yeah, but I think you have to have the story be..

Yeah, I mean, the story's got to sing.

The story's gotta sing, and the story needs some work, so I got that.

But just, but the bones of the story are what they are, right?

In terms of, hey, there's this new layer, right?

And again, as we told, new layer, get there fast.

This thing is huge.

It's not occupied yet.

We know it because we lived it.

We're building on what we've got.

Like all the ingredients are there, in my mind, right?

And that's why I'm doing this and excited about it, right?

And I have my money at work in this because I believe in it..

And you're energy and time.

Yeah.

No, exactly.

So, but when as you hear it now a little more, and again, knowing it's imperfect for sure, do you think that ingredients are there or do you worry?

Do you think you need more proof points, really ?

I don't know.

I mean, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have some momentum of a pipeline, you know, showing up of of some of the stuff converting and sales forcece being really active and eager.

Yeah.

I think also being , like, understanding when you say it's the new layer, like, a new layer that helps, like, the more specific we are on what the new layer can do, I think, surprisingly, the opportunity becomes...

Yeah.

So your coaching there is so don't refer to it as this nebulous new layer that's not helping you.

Right.

A more concrete view of it is important.

Yeah, it's something that people see as money.

Like, and that's why, you know, well, Delta Gun, like all these different places, they they turn you, and there's a reason for that.

I think it also makes it easier for a channel person to sell it .

Like, these are the three things that Synaptic does.

Yeah, no, for sure.

You know.

Okay.

And that's.

So anyway, I think we're close.

That's kind of why I'm excited.

I'm like, okay, you know.

But that that $3 million is going to go really quickly.

Oh, me.

That's scares me.

And so, we're closed, but I don't want to be, you know, we don't want to be in this thing , you know, nine months from now saying, oh, yeah.", we need another three, yeah.

Yeah.

I know, yeah.

Yeah.

All right, we're carrying really helpful feedback.

All right, what I'm going to do is I' I'll get a curated version of this C you see some other stuff we didn't go through , and then you can give feedback on it, which is great.

This has been really helpful and we'll, we'll keep it moving.

My pleasure.

We'll talk soon.

Have a good one.

Thank you.

You too.

Bye.

Be warm.

Likewise. .

God.

I love, man.

Fuck .

Please show me how you have the simulated view working .

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Okay.

Here we go.

Here's what we're talking about.
