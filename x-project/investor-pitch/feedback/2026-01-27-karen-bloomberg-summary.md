**Purpose:** Fundraising feedback and pitch review

## Key Investor Feedback

### 1. Lead with Specific Stories, Not Macro Trends

- Don't lead with "AI is the bottleneck" macro framing - everyone knows that
- Start with **concrete customer stories** (e.g., Delta Dental)
- "Particular to general is more powerful" - start with the specific, then zoom out
- 2-minute story format: "They didn't know what to do → Now our person is the luminary"

> "This is a thousand times more interesting than the funnel. Than the macro."

### 2. The Story Needs Work

- Current pitch feels "too macro and jargony"
- Sounds like "consultative AI" which doesn't land
- Need to make it easier for people to follow
- "A new layer" is too nebulous - be specific about what it does
- The more specific you are, surprisingly, the bigger the opportunity feels

### 3. Revenue Milestones Miss the Point

- $1M ARR isn't interesting as a goal anymore - AI companies scale too fast
- What Karen wants to see: **leading indicators of GTM motion**
  - Usage metrics and journey data
  - Organic growth signals
  - "Just add water" - evidence that hiring salespeople = revenue follows
  - Extrapolation potential from early data

> "I want to see some sort of organic... that you figured, you're starting to understand the GTM motion in a way that's interesting."

### 4. Investment Positioning

- The "safe place to invest" in AI: companies making it useful in specific domains
- Salesforce dependency is a strength: "They need to find ways to stay relevant"
- Having a services business alongside product isn't bad (East Coast investor view)
- But **lead with the AI product** - that's the growth story
- Domain expertise is a moat against OpenAI commoditization

> "Of all the people playing in this area, Salesforce is probably in a better position than many of the other companies."

### 5. Deck Structure Feedback

- Put AI product on top - lead with the growth engine
- Show the operating model and cash runway clearly
- Make the Salesforce channel story more concrete
- Need clear KPIs for the product business
- Separate the "beta" (services) from the "alpha" (product)

---

## Market Context (Karen's Observations)

- East Coast investors are panicked: missing AI wave + afraid of investing in front of the steam train
- West Coast investors even more panicked - seeing talent churn, companies getting decimated
- Models moving so quickly that some companies with crazy valuations are getting wiped out
- Safe harbor: companies with domain expertise making AI useful (not pure AI plays)

## Action Items

| Action | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| Send deck to Karen + Laurie for review | Immediate |
| Reframe pitch: lead with Delta Dental story, not macro | High |
| Define 3 concrete things Synaptic does (for channel partners to sell) | High |
| Create clear KPIs slide for AI product (usage, journey, extrapolation) | High |
| Simplify cash runway visualization (when do we run out, what's the buffer) | Medium |
| Build out pipeline/momentum proof points before bigger raise | Ongoing |

---

## Financial Discussion

- Raising $3M
- Current: $1M in bank
- Burn: ~$2.5-2.6M/year
- End state: ~$1.5M remaining at year end (fuel in tank for next move)
- Karen's concern: $3M goes quickly, need enough runway for channels to develop
