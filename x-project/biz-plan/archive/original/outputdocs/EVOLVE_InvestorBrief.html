      <strong>The Pitch in One Sentence</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      EVOLVE is the first end-to-end platform that discovers how your business
      actually works, designs optimal transformation paths, deploys AI agents
      autonomously, and continuously improves performance—turning process
      transformation from a multi-year consulting-led quagmire into an
      automated, high-velocity platform that brings transformation to millions
      of organizations with confidence, clarity, and speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What Makes This Possible:</strong> A modern platform and business
      model that can operate at scale and velocity impossible for traditional
      consulting-led or heavyweight enterprise tools, combined with network
      effects that make the platform smarter with every customer.

      Every company knows they need to transform: automate processes, deploy AI
      agents, improve efficiency. But
      <strong>95% of transformation initiatives fail</strong>—not because the
      technology doesn’t work, but because companies are
      <strong>flying blind</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>They don’t know what to transform</strong>: No visibility into
        actual processes (only imagined workflows)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>They don’t know where to start</strong>: No way to prioritize by
        ROI or compare to peers
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>They don’t know if it’s working</strong>: No continuous
        monitoring or assurance that improvements stick
      </li>

      <strong>Management Consulting Approach:</strong> * Hire McKinsey/Bain for
      $2M+ to map processes and create PowerPoint strategy * Takes 6-12 months
      to produce recommendations * No execution, no technology, no continuous
      improvement * Only enterprises can afford it—<strong

      <strong>Heavyweight Enterprise Tools:</strong> *
      <strong>Process mining vendors</strong> (Celonis, UiPath, SAP Signavio)
      sell $100K-500K deployments * Static reports and dashboards—no
      transformation execution, no agent deployment * Require consultants and
      3-6 month implementations * Enterprise-only pricing
      <strong>excludes 99% of businesses</strong> * Each customer siloed—no
      cross-company learning or peer benchmarking
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>RPA Platforms:</strong> * Require perfect process definitions
      upfront (chicken-and-egg problem) * Brittle automations that break with
      any process change * No discovery, no intelligence, no continuous learning
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Custom Agent Development:</strong> * Takes months with no
      guarantee of ROI * Assumes you already know what to automate * Every

    </h3>
    <p>
      Traditional transformation is like old-school self-driving cars: expensive
      specialized sensors (consultants), limited adoption (enterprise-only),
      isolated learning (each project starts from scratch).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >EVOLVE replicates Tesla’s winning formula for transformation:</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Commodity Components Replace Expensive Specialists</strong> *
      Uses standard LLMs and vision AI instead of specialized consultants *
      Edge-first architecture pushes compute to user devices * Massively lowers
      deployment costs and solves security concerns * Makes enterprise-grade
      transformation accessible to <strong>millions of SMBs</strong>, not just
      Fortune 1000
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Fleet Learning Model Creates Compounding Advantage</strong> *
      Just as Tesla’s millions of vehicles make their autopilot smarter every
      day, EVOLVE’s user base creates compounding intelligence * Every workflow
      captured (anonymously) improves recommendations for everyone * Edge
      processing preserves privacy while contributing to aggregate intelligence
      * More users = better benchmarks = smarter recommendations = better
      outcomes = more users *
      <strong>This is what consulting can never do</strong>: learn and improve
      across thousands of companies simultaneously
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Freemium Adoption Model Eliminates Barriers</strong> *
      Discovery and mining are FREE—not the product, but the on-ramp * Build
      massive user base contributing workflow intelligence * Monetize
      transformation execution and continuous improvement * Land-and-expand
      built into the product experience *

      <strong>The Insight Advantage: What Leaders Desperately Need</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Business leaders are starving for competitive intelligence: * “How do my
      peers in similar companies handle this process?” * “Am I overstaffed or
      understaffed compared to industry norms?” * “What’s the best-practice
      workflow for this scenario?” * “Where should I focus my transformation
      efforts for maximum ROI?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>EVOLVE provides the answers no one else can:</strong> With
      thousands of users across industries and platforms, we can show you
      exactly how your processes compare to peers—not vague benchmarks, but
      specific, actionable insights mapped to your actual workflows. This
      intelligence becomes more valuable as our user base grows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>This is the transformation market’s “data moat”</strong>: Once we

    <p>
      <strong>Multiple convergent forces make this the right moment:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <strong>Agent economy emerging</strong> but companies lack
        infrastructure to participate (flying blind)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Process intelligence democratizing</strong> through commodity AI
        components (no longer requires expensive specialists)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Freemium SaaS models proven</strong> in adjacent categories
        (Slack, Figma, Notion showed the playbook)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Edge AI becoming viable</strong> with improved local LLM
        performance (solves security and cost)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SMB digital transformation accelerating</strong> post-pandemic
        (demand is massive)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Economic pressure</strong> driving demand for measurable, rapid
        ROI (can’t afford 6-month consulting projects)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Traditional vendors trapped</strong> in enterprise-only business
        models (can’t pivot to serve millions of SMBs)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Timing-specific opportunity in Salesforce entry wedge:</strong> *
      Salesforce acquired Apromore in 2024; integration timeline ~12 months *
      Gives us timing window to establish position in Service Cloud SMB market
      before platform vendor competition * Even after Apromore launches, we win
      through independence positioning (customers prefer independent layer) and
      SMB focus (Salesforce targets enterprises first)

      <strong>Our Entry Beachhead: Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      We’re starting with a
      <strong>defined, measurable, defensible beachhead</strong> to prove the
      model: Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs. This is a tactical entry point, not
      the full market opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Salesforce Service Cloud TAM: $5.4B</strong> *
      <strong>90,000-105,000 Service Cloud customers</strong> globally *
      <strong>1.2-1.5M customer service agents</strong> total *
      <strong>Per-agent model</strong>: $350-400/month × 12 months =
      $4,200-4,800/year per agent * <strong>Total market</strong>: 1.2M agents ×
      $4,500/year = <strong>$5.4B annually</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Salesforce Service Cloud SAM: $1.08B</strong> (Our Realistic
      Target)
    </p>
    <p>
      Filtering for optimal customers: * <strong>Company size</strong>: 20-500
      employees (sweet spot for SMB/mid-market) *
      <strong>Priority verticals</strong>: Technology/SaaS, Professional
      Services, Financial Services (highest automation ROI) *
      <strong>Geography</strong>: North America initially (60% of Salesforce
      customers) * <strong>Service team size</strong>: 5+ agents (minimum for
      meaningful automation)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Result:</strong> ~20,000 target customers with 240,000 agents =
      <strong>$1.08B opportunity</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Salesforce Service Cloud SOM: $71M-$212M ARR</strong> (Years 3-5)
    </p>
    <p>
      Conservative penetration targets: * <strong>Year 1</strong>: 1% SAM (200
      customers, 2,000 agents) = $8.4M ARR * <strong>Year 3</strong>: 7% SAM
      (1,400 customers, 16,800 agents) = $71M ARR * <strong>Year 5</strong>: 18%
      SAM (3,600 customers, 50,400 agents) = $212M ARR
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why These Numbers Are Achievable:</strong> * AppExchange provides
      low-CAC distribution ($200-500 vs. $5,000+) * Salesforce-native = &lt;1
      day deployment vs. weeks for competitors * Simple value prop:
      $375/agent/month to save $2,400/agent/month = 544% ROI * 12-month head
      start before Apromore integration * Comparable Salesforce ISVs (Gong,
      Clari) achieve 3-8% penetration
    </p>
    <p><strong>Expansion Beyond Salesforce (Year 3+):</strong></p>
    <p>
      Once we dominate Salesforce Service Cloud, we expand to: 1.
      <strong>Sales Cloud</strong> (sales ops automation for existing customers)
      2. <strong>ServiceNow</strong> (apply proven model to ServiceNow Service
      Management) 3. <strong>Zendesk, Microsoft Dynamics</strong> (other service
      platforms) 4. <strong>Standalone</strong> (companies with custom/multiple
      systems)

    <p><strong>This validates our top-down TAM of $127B</strong> ✓</p>
    <p>
      The technology spend TAM ($127B) actually understates the opportunity
      because it doesn’t fully account for the labor displacement value.
      Companies will pay us a fraction of the human labor savings we create.

      <strong>Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $300M ARR by Year 5</strong>
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Our Realistic 5-Year Target:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Starting from $0.5M ARR in Year 1, reaching $300M ARR by Year 5
      represents: * <strong>~1% of SAM</strong> (conservative for category
      leader) * <strong>~0.3% of bottom-up TAM</strong> (extremely conservative)
      * <strong>88,000 workers automated</strong> (assuming $3,400 average
      revenue per worker)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Why This Is Achievable:</strong></p>
    <p>
      With our freemium model and SMB-first approach: * Year 1: 10,000 free
      users → 500 paid users → $0.5M ARR * Year 2: 50,000 free users → 5,000
      paid users → $5M ARR * Year 3: 200,000 free users → 20,000 paid users →
      $20M ARR * Year 4: 500,000 free users → 50,000 paid users → $100M ARR *

      companies in US alone * Lower compliance friction (faster sales cycles) *
      High need for cost efficiency * Traditional vendors ignore this segment
      (too expensive to serve) * <strong>Our advantage</strong>: Freemium model
      + edge architecture = viable economics
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mid-Market (500-2,000 employees) - Expansion:</strong> * 35,000
      companies * Budget for transformation but need proven ROI * Will follow
      SMB adoption curve * Network effects strongest here (peer comparison
      value)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enterprise (2,000-10,000 employees) - Upmarket:</strong> * 8,000
      companies * Traditional vendor stronghold * Will demand our solution once
      proven in SMB/mid-market * “Why can’t we use this if it works for smaller
      companies?” * Highest revenue per customer ($500K-$5M+)

      Traditional process mining vendors focused exclusively on enterprise

      * Complex integrations only made sense for sophisticated buyers * Sales
      cycles and support requirements too expensive for SMB
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>EVOLVE changes the economics:</strong> * Edge-first architecture

      <strong>Salesforce Apromore</strong> (Timing Consideration for Entry
      Wedge):
    </p>
    <p>
      Salesforce acquired Apromore in 2024. Integration timeline: ~12 months.
      This creates a timing opportunity in our Salesforce entry wedge, but
      EVOLVE’s strategic advantages extend far beyond Salesforce:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Why we’ll succeed regardless of Apromore:</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <strong>Independence Advantage</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Customers prefer independent process intelligence layer over
            platform vendor (Datadog vs AWS, Slack vs Microsoft Teams)
          </li>
          <li>
            EVOLVE works across Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, custom
            systems—not locked to one platform
          </li>
          <li>
            Apromore will be Salesforce-only, limiting appeal for multi-system
            companies
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SMB Market Segmentation</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Salesforce will target enterprises first (where their revenue is)
          </li>
          <li>
            Our SMB-first approach captures 44,000-51,000 Service Cloud SMBs
            they’ll ignore
          </li>
          <li>
            By the time platform vendors go downmarket, we’ll have network
            effects and established brand
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cross-Platform Network Effects</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Our aggregate intelligence spans multiple platforms (not just
            Salesforce)
          </li>
          <li>
            Salesforce data siloed per customer; we aggregate patterns across
            all systems
          </li>
          <li>This creates a moat no single platform vendor can replicate</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Platform-Agnostic Strategy</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Salesforce is our entry point, not our only market</li>
          <li>
            Same model applies to ServiceNow, Zendesk, Microsoft Dynamics,
            standalone systems
          </li>
          <li>
            Apromore validates the market need but doesn’t threaten our broader
            platform strategy

      <strong>Industry Benchmarks</strong>: Peer comparison data that doesn’t
      exist anywhere else * <strong>Cross-platform insights</strong>: Unique
      visibility across Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and custom systems *
      <strong>Consulting can’t compete</strong>: We learn from 10,000+ companies
      simultaneously; they learn from 50-100 clients
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Network Effects (Winner-takes-most):</strong> *
      <strong>More users</strong> → More workflow data → Better recommendations
      &amp; benchmarks * <strong>Better recommendations</strong> → Higher
      success rates → More word-of-mouth * <strong>More deployments</strong> →
      More learning → Smarter agents * <strong>Cross-pollination</strong>:
      Insights from one industry benefit adjacent industries *
      <strong>Platform flywheel</strong>: Each new platform integration
      (Salesforce, ServiceNow, etc.) makes the network stronger
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Business Model Moat (Structural advantage):</strong> *
      <strong>Freemium motion</strong>: Creates 10-100x more users than
      enterprise vendors * <strong>SMB-first economics</strong>: Build scale
      where competitors can’t follow ($20K deals work for us, not them) *
      <strong>Per-agent simplicity</strong>: “$375/agent/month” = transparent,
      calculable, shareable * <strong>Automated delivery</strong>: Platform
      scales without linear headcount growth *
      <strong>Aggregate intelligence</strong>: Creates switching costs (lose
      peer benchmarks if you leave) * <strong>Competitors trapped</strong>:
      Legacy vendors can’t pivot to freemium without destroying revenue
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. Independence Moat (Customer Preference):</strong> *
      <strong>Platform-agnostic architecture</strong>: Works across all major
      business process platforms * <strong>Customer trust</strong>: Independent
      layer preferred over platform vendor control (Datadog vs AWS dynamic) *
      <strong>No lock-in fear</strong>: Complements existing systems, doesn’t
      replace them * <strong>Multi-vendor optionality</strong>: Not dependent on
      any single platform’s roadmap or pricing
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5. Technology Moat (Defensible but commoditizing):</strong> *
      <strong>Edge-first architecture</strong>: Privacy-preserving discovery
      with local LLM inference * <strong>Multi-layer intelligence</strong>:
      Across four transformation phases (MINE, DESIGN, DELIVER, MANAGE) *
      <strong>Shadow mode validation</strong>: Proves agent effectiveness before
      production deployment * <strong>Process digital twin</strong>: Living
      model of actual workflows, not imagined processes
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6. Entry Market Advantages (Tactical head start):</strong> *
      <strong>Salesforce expertise</strong>: Existing relationships and
      ecosystem knowledge for fast initial traction *
      <strong>AppExchange distribution</strong>: Low-CAC customer acquisition
      ($200-500 vs. $5,000+) in entry market *
      <strong>Service Cloud specialization</strong>: Focused beachhead with weak
      competition (Hubble, elements.cloud) * <strong>Timing window</strong>:
      12-month head start before Salesforce Apromore integration
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The result:</strong> A data and network flywheel that accelerates
      while competitors stand still. Every new user makes us stronger across all
      platforms. The gap widens every day, and no single platform vendor can
      replicate our cross-platform intelligence.

      <strong>Revenue Multipliers:</strong> 1. <strong>SMB volume</strong>:
      150,000 companies we can reach (vs. 8,000 enterprises) 2.
      <strong>Network leverage</strong>: More free users = better product =
      higher conversion 3. <strong>Usage expansion</strong>: More agents = more
      token consumption 4. <strong>Peer benchmarking value</strong>: Increases
      with user base size 5. <strong>Upmarket movement</strong>: SMB success

      <strong>Our Tactical Entry Point: Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      To prove the model and build momentum quickly, we’re starting with
      <strong>Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs</strong>—a market we know well,
      where we can move fast, and where competition is weak or slow.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Why This Entry Point:</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <strong>We have existing customers and relationships</strong>: Deep
        Salesforce ecosystem knowledge and Service Cloud experience
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salesforce sellers become advocates</strong>: They need tools to
        create clear value and unstick prospects; they’ve struggled with
        AgentForce value selling; EVOLVE provides the independent validation
        layer they need
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>We can land quickly</strong>: AppExchange provides low-CAC
        distribution ($200-500 vs $5,000+), &lt;1 day deployment
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Timing window</strong>: Salesforce acquired Apromore—we have ~12
        months to establish position before their integration
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Weak competition</strong>: Current Salesforce process mining
        players (Hubble, elements.cloud) have lightweight, non-compelling
        products
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Underserved SMB segment</strong>: 44,000-51,000 Service Cloud
        SMB customers ignored by enterprise vendors
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clear value prop</strong>: $350-400 per agent per month = simple
        ROI calculation
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>The Entry Wedge:</strong> *
      <strong>90,000-105,000 Salesforce Service Cloud customers</strong> with
      1.2-1.5M service agents * <strong>$5.4B TAM</strong> within Service Cloud
      alone * Prove model with SMBs → Expand to mid-market/enterprise → Apply
      playbook to ServiceNow, Zendesk, Microsoft Dynamics, standalone systems
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >This is a tactical entry point, not our strategic positioning.</strong
      >
      Salesforce gives us a beachhead to prove transformation at scale with
      modern business model. Once proven, the same playbook applies across any
      business process platform.

      <strong>AppExchange Freemium Execution:</strong> 1. Free Service Cloud
      process discovery app on AppExchange 2. Automatic workflow analysis of
      Service Cloud case data 3. Within 2 weeks: “You can save $245,000/year by

    <p>
      <strong
        >1. Salesforce Sellers as Advocates &amp; Enablers (Key Channel)</strong
      >
      * <strong>Why Salesforce sellers will champion EVOLVE:</strong> * They
      need ways to create clear value so prospects can get unstuck * They need
      independent opinions and visibility tools to help prospects move forward *
      They’ve struggled with value selling AgentForce (need complementary
      solutions) * EVOLVE provides the “independent validation” layer that
      unsticks deals * <strong>Execution</strong>: ISV co-selling program, joint
      account planning, deal registration *
      <strong>Value to Salesforce</strong>: Increases Service Cloud stickiness
      and expansion revenue
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. AppExchange + Viral Ecosystem Marketing</strong> *
      <strong>AppExchange</strong>: Free offering drives product-led discovery
      (Featured/Premier listing goal) * <strong>Dreamforce</strong>:
      Sponsorship, booth presence, speaking opportunities, AppExchange showcase
      * <strong>Regional events</strong>: Salesforce World Tours,
      industry-specific Salesforce events *
      <strong>Community engagement</strong>: Salesforce Success Community,
      Trailblazer Community, user groups * <strong>Content marketing</strong>:
      “Service Cloud automation,” “Salesforce AI agents,” case studies
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Salesforce Partner Ecosystem</strong> * Partnerships with
      Salesforce consultants and system integrators * Referral programs with
      implementation partners * Co-marketing with complementary AppExchange
      vendors
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Target Customer Personas:</strong> * VP Customer Success at
      Service Cloud customers (100-500 employees) * Customer Service Managers
      managing 5-25 agent teams * Salesforce Admins looking for native
      automation solutions * Operations Directors seeking cost efficiency in
      service delivery
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Viral Growth Mechanics:</strong> *
      <strong>Salesforce seller referrals</strong>: Account execs recommend
      EVOLVE to unstick prospect deals *
      <strong>AppExchange social proof</strong>: Ratings, reviews, and
      “Featured” status drive discovery *
      <strong>Peer benchmarking FOMO</strong>: “Similar companies automate 50%
      vs. your 20%” creates urgency * <strong>Simple pricing</strong>:
      “$375/agent/month” easy to share and calculate *
      <strong>Community advocacy</strong>: User group discussions (“How are you
      automating Service Cloud workflows?”)
    </p>

      <strong>The opportunity:</strong> Just as Tesla built a fleet that made

      Every company—from 100-employee SMBs to 10,000-employee enterprises—will
      need to transform continuously. We’re building the platform that makes
      that possible, starting where the incumbents can’t follow, and capturing

      <strong>Why No One Can Compete in SMB</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Legacy Vendors Can’t Serve SMB:</strong> * Average deal size:
      $100K-500K (SMB can’t afford) * Sales model: Enterprise field sales ($50K+
      cost per customer) * Implementation: Requires consultants and integration
      partners * Cloud architecture: Security concerns, high compute costs *
      <strong>Economics simply don’t work at $10K-50K deal sizes</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Startups Can’t Build Network Fast Enough:</strong> * Network
      effects require massive scale * Need years to accumulate workflow
      intelligence * First mover advantage in SMB market * We’re building the
      network now—by the time they try, insurmountable lead
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tech Giants Could (But Won’t):</strong> * Microsoft, Salesforce,
      Google could build networks * But SMB process mining isn’t strategic to
      their core * Would require dedicated go-to-market and product focus *
      Acquisition more likely than build (we’re the acquisition target)

      <strong>The Disruption Timeline</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Year 1: SMB Dominance</strong> * EVOLVE: 50,000 SMB users, network
      effects visible, $1-2M ARR * Competitors: Unaware or dismissive (“SMB
      isn’t our market”)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Year 2: Mid-Market Threat</strong> * EVOLVE: 200,000 users,
      mid-market traction, $10-20M ARR, peer benchmarking = killer feature *
      Competitors: Beginning to understand threat, attempting SMB plays (failing
      due to cost structure)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Year 3: Enterprise Encroachment</strong> * EVOLVE: 500,000+ users,
      enterprise wins, $50-100M ARR, category leader * Competitors: Attempting
      network strategies (too late, can’t change business model), acquisition
      discussions
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Year 4-5: Category Ownership</strong> * EVOLVE: 1-2M users,
      $200-300M ARR, de facto standard for SMB/mid-market, strong enterprise
      presence * Competitors: Acquisition or irrelevance
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The result</strong>: EVOLVE becomes the work automation platform
      across all segments. We own the SMB and mid-market categories entirely,
      and compete strongly in enterprise with overwhelming advantages from
      scale, aggregate intelligence, and peer benchmarking capabilities.
