# **EVOLVE: The Agent Assurance & ROI Platform**

## **The Pitch in One Sentence**

EVOLVE is the first Agent Assurance & ROI platform that combines process mining, task mining, org mining, and agent observability to show companies exactly what to automate, prove the ROI, and continuously ensure AI agents are delivering value—starting with Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs and expanding to become the nervous system for business transformation across all platforms.

**What Makes This Uniquely Possible:** We're the only platform that integrates all four layers—process intelligence (workflows), task intelligence (what people actually do), org intelligence (system configurations and tech debt), and agent intelligence (AI agent performance and ROI)—enabling capabilities no one else can deliver, like predicting which broken Salesforce flow is blocking $1.2M in agent savings and automatically fixing it.

**The Category:** We're creating the Agent Assurance & Org Health category—not just "better process mining," but the essential infrastructure for companies to deploy, monitor, and continuously improve AI agents with confidence and measurable ROI.

---

## **Executive Summary (Read This First)**

**The Opportunity:** $98B labor savings TAM + $127B technology TAM at the intersection of AI agents and business process transformation. We're creating a new category: Agent Assurance & Org Health.

**The Problem:** 95% of AI/automation initiatives fail because companies can't answer: "What should we automate? What's the ROI? Is it actually working?" Traditional process mining vendors ($100K-500K, enterprise-only) and consultants ($2M+, 6-12 months) have locked out 150,000+ SMBs and most mid-market companies.

**The Solution:** EVOLVE integrates four intelligence layers no one else combines:

1. **Process Mining**: Workflow intelligence
2. **Task Mining**: What people actually do (edge-first, privacy-preserving)
3. **Org Mining**: System configuration & tech debt (Salesforce Org MRI - unique to us)
4. **Agent Observability**: AI agent performance & ROI (AgentOps Flight Recorder)

This enables capabilities impossible for competitors: "Your refund agent failed because Salesforce flow X conflicts with rule Y—fix it to restore $85K/month."

**The Business Model:** Freemium SMB-first disruption

- Free: Mining & discovery (build massive user base)
- Paid: Agent deployment & transformation execution
- Enterprise: Full platform with EVOLVE Transformation Score (our FICO for agent readiness)

**The Wedge:** Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs via AppExchange (44K-51K companies, $5.4B TAM, weak competition), then expand to ServiceNow, Zendesk, multi-cloud.

**The Moat:** Network effects from cross-company data + proprietary EVOLVE Transformation Score + four-layer integration competitors can't replicate without rebuilding their entire stack.

**The Traction Path:**

- Year 1: $1-2M ARR (1,000 customers, SMB-dominant)
- Year 3: $20-40M ARR (10,000 customers, moving to mid-market)
- Year 5: $150-300M ARR (25,000-35,000 customers, strong enterprise presence)

**The Ask:** $2-3M seed extension for 18-24 month runway to Series A readiness ($6M ARR, 130%+ NDR, category leadership).

**Why Now:** Agent economy emerging but lacking infrastructure. SMB digital transformation accelerating. Edge AI now viable. Traditional vendors trapped in enterprise-only models. 12-month window before Salesforce integrates Apromore.

## The Problem: Transformation is Gated by a Lack of Modern Tools to Drive the Transformation Process

**Transformation has become the defining challenge for modern businesses—yet the technology and services to enable it remain traditional and unable to meet the opportunity. Ironically, transformation itself is in need of transformation.**

Every company knows they need to transform: automate processes, deploy AI agents, improve efficiency. But **95% of transformation initiatives fail**—not because the technology doesn't work, but because companies are **flying blind**:

- **They don't know what to transform**: No visibility into actual processes (only imagined workflows)
- **They don't know where to start**: No way to prioritize by ROI or compare to peers
- **They don't know if it's working**: No continuous monitoring or assurance that improvements stick

**This has stalled the entire transformation market:**

### **The Traditional Model Can't Keep Up (But it Still Dominates)**

**Management Consulting Approach:**

- Hire McKinsey/Bain for $2M+ to map processes and create PowerPoint strategy
- Takes 6-12 months to produce recommendations
- No execution, no technology, no continuous improvement
- Only enterprises can afford it—**millions of SMBs and mid-market companies completely locked out**

**Heavyweight Enterprise Tools:**

- **Process mining vendors** (Celonis, UiPath, SAP Signavio) sell $100K-500K deployments
- Static reports and dashboards—no transformation execution, no agent deployment
- Require consultants and 3-6 month implementations
- Enterprise-only pricing **excludes 99% of businesses**
- Each customer siloed—no cross-company learning or peer benchmarking

**RPA Platforms:**

- Require perfect process definitions upfront (chicken-and-egg problem)
- Brittle automations that break with any process change
- No discovery, no intelligence, no continuous learning

**Custom Agent Development:**

- Takes months with no guarantee of ROI
- Assumes you already know what to automate
- Every company reinvents the wheel

### **The Result: Millions Are Stuck**

- **150,000+ SMBs** have formal process needs but can't afford consulting or enterprise tools
- **Mid-market companies** waste millions on failed RPA and consulting projects
- **Even enterprises** see 95% failure rate on AI/automation initiatives
- **Business leaders are guessing**: "What should we automate? What's the ROI? How do we compare to peers?"

**The transformation market desperately needs what the software industry learned 20 years ago:**

- **Freemium** to drive adoption at scale
- **Product-led growth** to eliminate sales friction
- **Network effects** so the product gets smarter with every user
- **SMB-first** to reach millions, not just thousands

**No one has brought this modern business model to transformation. Until now.**

## **The EVOLVE Four-Layer Advantage: What's Only Possible When You Do All Four Together**

**The insight:** Every other player tackles one layer—process mining vendors see workflows, task mining tools see user actions, Salesforce consultants see org config, agent platforms see agent performance. But the magic happens when you integrate all four:

**Layer 1: Process Mining** - How work flows through your organization

- Traditional vendors stop here: static dashboards showing workflow bottlenecks

**Layer 2: Task Mining** - What people actually do at their desks

- Shows the gap between "designed process" and "actual work"
- Edge-first, privacy-preserving observation using local LLMs

**Layer 3: Org Mining (Salesforce Org MRI)** - Your system's configuration, automation, and technical debt

- Maps all Salesforce flows, triggers, validation rules, page layouts
- Identifies: 147 flows, 34 redundant, 12 conflicting, 21 never triggered, 8 blocking agent adoption
- **Only EVOLVE delivers this for Salesforce environments**

**Layer 4: Agent Observability (AgentOps Flight Recorder)** - AI agent performance, reliability, and ROI

- Every agent interaction logged: inputs, outputs, handoffs, overrides, business impact
- SLAs/SLOs for agents: latency, success rate, escalation rate, drift detection
- Closed-loop ROI ledger connecting agent actions to dollars saved/earned
- **Only EVOLVE treats agents as first-class citizens in process intelligence**

**The Compounding Effect - Examples of What Only EVOLVE Can Do:**

1. **"Your refund agent's denial rate jumped 40% last week because a Salesforce validation rule changed—fix this specific rule to restore $85K/month in automated refunds."**
   - Requires: Agent telemetry + org config mining + process impact analysis

2. **"These 5 org cleanup actions will unlock 18% more agent automation safely, based on patterns from 347 similar companies."**
   - Requires: Org mining + peer benchmarks + agent readiness modeling

3. **"Your EVOLVE Transformation Score is 61; peers at your size/vertical average 72. Here are the 3 highest-ROI moves to close that gap."**
   - Requires: All four layers + aggregate cross-company intelligence

**This integrated approach is our defensible moat**—competitors would need to rebuild their entire stack and business model to match it.

---

## **The Solution: The EVOLVE Platform**

**EVOLVE is the Tesla of business process transformation.** Just as Tesla democratized self-driving with commodity cameras instead of expensive LIDAR sensors, EVOLVE uses commodity LLMs and vision AI to make enterprise-grade process intelligence accessible to businesses of all sizes—from SMBs to enterprises.

### **The Complete Transformation Lifecycle**

### **The Result: A Self-Improving Intelligence System**

EVOLVE doesn't just transform your processes once—it creates a continuous improvement engine that gets smarter as your business evolves. You move from static process maps to a living system that observes, learns, optimizes, and reports autonomously.

### **The EVOLVE Transformation Score: Your FICO for Agent Readiness & Org Health**

**One number the C-suite obsesses over.**

The EVOLVE Transformation Score is a proprietary composite metric (0-100) that fuses all four intelligence layers into a single, actionable health indicator:

**Score Components:**

- **Process Health (25%)**: Bottlenecks, rework rates, SLA adherence, cycle times
- **Org Fitness (25%)**: Salesforce config quality, automation tech debt, flow conflicts, unused rules
- **Agent Performance (25%)**: Coverage %, success rates, escalation rates, reliability scores
- **Realized ROI (25%)**: Labor hours saved, cost reduction, quality improvements, revenue impact

**Why This Matters:**

- **Board-level visibility**: "Our EVOLVE Score improved from 61 → 78 in 9 months"
- **Peer comparison**: "Peers in B2B SaaS with 10-25 agents average 72; you're at 61"
- **Actionable roadmap**: Score automatically generates top 3 initiatives to improve by 10+ points
- **Only EVOLVE can calculate this**—requires process + task + org + agent telemetry integrated

**The Defensibility:** This becomes _the_ standard metric for transformation health, like FICO for credit or NPS for customer satisfaction. Once executives adopt EVOLVE Scores in board decks, switching costs become massive.

---

## **Why This Matters Now**

### **The Tesla Parallel: Democratizing Transformation Through Modern Technology**

Traditional transformation is like old-school self-driving cars: expensive specialized sensors (consultants), limited adoption (enterprise-only), isolated learning (each project starts from scratch).

**EVOLVE replicates Tesla's winning formula for transformation:**

**1. Commodity Components Replace Expensive Specialists**

- Uses standard LLMs and vision AI instead of specialized consultants
- Edge-first architecture pushes compute to user devices
- Massively lowers deployment costs and solves security concerns
- Makes enterprise-grade transformation accessible to **millions of SMBs**, not just Fortune 1000

**2. Fleet Learning Model Creates Compounding Advantage**

- Just as Tesla's millions of vehicles make their autopilot smarter every day, EVOLVE's user base creates compounding intelligence
- Every workflow captured (anonymously) improves recommendations for everyone
- Edge processing preserves privacy while contributing to aggregate intelligence
- More users = better benchmarks = smarter recommendations = better outcomes = more users
- **This is what consulting can never do**: learn and improve across thousands of companies simultaneously

**3. Freemium Adoption Model Eliminates Barriers**

- Discovery and mining are FREE—not the product, but the on-ramp
- Build massive user base contributing workflow intelligence
- Monetize transformation execution and continuous improvement
- Land-and-expand built into the product experience
- **Brings transformation to 150,000+ organizations currently locked out**

### **The Insight Advantage: What Leaders Desperately Need**

Business leaders are starving for competitive intelligence:

- "How do my peers in similar companies handle this process?"
- "Am I overstaffed or understaffed compared to industry norms?"
- "What's the best-practice workflow for this scenario?"
- "Where should I focus my transformation efforts for maximum ROI?"

**EVOLVE provides the answers no one else can:** With thousands of users across industries and platforms, we can show you exactly how your processes compare to peers—not vague benchmarks, but specific, actionable insights mapped to your actual workflows. This intelligence becomes more valuable as our user base grows.

**This is the transformation market's "data moat"**: Once we have thousands of companies contributing anonymized workflow data, competitors can't catch up. Consulting firms have insights from 50-100 clients; we'll have insights from 10,000+ companies.

### **Perfect Market Timing**

**Multiple convergent forces make this the right moment:**

1. **Agent economy emerging** but companies lack infrastructure to participate (flying blind)
2. **Process intelligence democratizing** through commodity AI components (no longer requires expensive specialists)
3. **Freemium SaaS models proven** in adjacent categories (Slack, Figma, Notion showed the playbook)
4. **Edge AI becoming viable** with improved local LLM performance (solves security and cost)
5. **SMB digital transformation accelerating** post-pandemic (demand is massive)
6. **Economic pressure** driving demand for measurable, rapid ROI (can't afford 6-month consulting projects)
7. **Traditional vendors trapped** in enterprise-only business models (can't pivot to serve millions of SMBs)

**Timing-specific opportunity in Salesforce entry wedge:**

- Salesforce acquired Apromore in 2024; integration timeline ~12 months
- Gives us timing window to establish position in Service Cloud SMB market before platform vendor competition
- Even after Apromore launches, we win through independence positioning (customers prefer independent layer) and SMB focus (Salesforce targets enterprises first)

---

## **Market Opportunity: The Transformation Market**

### **Our Entry Beachhead: Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs**

We're starting with a **defined, measurable, defensible beachhead** to prove the model: Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs. This is a tactical entry point, not the full market opportunity.

**Salesforce Service Cloud TAM: $5.4B**

- **90,000-105,000 Service Cloud customers** globally
- **1.2-1.5M customer service agents** total
- **Per-agent model**: $350-400/month × 12 months = $4,200-4,800/year per agent
- **Total market**: 1.2M agents × $4,500/year = **$5.4B annually**

**Salesforce Service Cloud SAM: $1.08B** (Our Realistic Target)

Filtering for optimal customers:

- **Company size**: 20-500 employees (sweet spot for SMB/mid-market)
- **Priority verticals**: Technology/SaaS, Professional Services, Financial Services (highest automation ROI)
- **Geography**: North America initially (60% of Salesforce customers)
- **Service team size**: 5+ agents (minimum for meaningful automation)

**Result:** ~20,000 target customers with 240,000 agents = **$1.08B opportunity**

**Salesforce Service Cloud SOM: $71M-$212M ARR** (Years 3-5)

Conservative penetration targets:

- **Year 1**: 1% SAM (200 customers, 2,000 agents) = $8.4M ARR
- **Year 3**: 7% SAM (1,400 customers, 16,800 agents) = $71M ARR
- **Year 5**: 18% SAM (3,600 customers, 50,400 agents) = $212M ARR

**Why These Numbers Are Achievable:**

- AppExchange provides low-CAC distribution ($200-500 vs. $5,000+)
- Salesforce-native = <1 day deployment vs. weeks for competitors
- Simple value prop: $375/agent/month to save $2,400/agent/month = 544% ROI
- 12-month head start before Apromore integration
- Comparable Salesforce ISVs (Gong, Clari) achieve 3-8% penetration

**Expansion Beyond Salesforce (Year 3+):**

Once we dominate Salesforce Service Cloud, we expand to:

1. **Sales Cloud** (sales ops automation for existing customers)
2. **ServiceNow** (apply proven model to ServiceNow Service Management)
3. **Zendesk, Microsoft Dynamics** (other service platforms)
4. **Standalone** (companies with custom/multiple systems)

This creates the path to the broader TAM described below.

---

### **The Broader Market Opportunity**

The EVOLVE opportunity spans two distinct but complementary value pools:

**1. Technology Spend (Software Displacement)**
**2. Labor Cost Savings (Human Work Automation)**

### **Total Technology Spend TAM (Top-Down)**

**Total Addressable Market (TAM): $127B by 2030**

This represents the converging technology budgets we're targeting:

- **AI Agents Market**: $68B
  - Gartner projects AI agent platforms reaching $68B by 2030
  - CAGR: 35%
  - Source: Gartner AI & ML Market Forecast 2024

- **Process Mining Market**: $23B
  - Process mining and discovery tools
  - CAGR: 33%
  - Source: MarketsandMarkets Process Mining Report 2024

- **RPA Market**: $36B
  - Robotic Process Automation spending
  - CAGR: 27%
  - Source: Grand View Research RPA Market Analysis 2024

**Combined TAM: $127B** (technologies we disrupt or complement)

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): $31B**

Filtering for our realistic reach:

**Geographic Filter:**

- US, UK, EU markets (75% of global spend)
- $127B × 0.75 = $95B

**Company Size Filter:**

- Target: 100-10,000 employees
- These represent 60% of technology spend in this category
- $95B × 0.60 = $57B

**Role/Department Filter:**

- Focus on high-volume, repetitive functions
- Sales Ops, Customer Support, Finance Ops, IT Service Mgmt, HR Ops
- These functions represent 55% of automation spend
- $57B × 0.55 = $31B

**Our SAM: $31B** (realistic technology market we can capture)

### **Approach 2: Labor Cost Savings (Bottom-Up)**

**This is where the real value lies.** Businesses don't buy software for its own sake—they buy outcomes. The primary outcome is reducing labor costs while improving quality and speed.

**Target Worker Population:**

**Global Knowledge Workers in Automatable Roles:**

- Total global knowledge workers: 1.25 billion (ILO data)
- In repetitive, process-oriented roles: 25%
- **Automatable knowledge workers: 312M globally**

**Filtered for Our Market:**

- US/UK/EU markets: 120M workers (38% of global)
- In companies 100-10,000 employees: 48M workers (40% of regional)
- In target roles (Sales Ops, Support, Finance, IT, HR): **29M workers**

**Value Calculation Per Worker:**

Each knowledge worker we help automate creates measurable value:

- **Average fully-loaded cost per knowledge worker**: $85,000/year
  - Base salary: $60,000
  - Benefits, taxes, overhead: $25,000
  - Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics + standard burden rates

- **EVOLVE automation potential**: 40% of work hours
  - Discovery identifies automatable tasks
  - Agents handle 30-50% of repetitive work
  - Conservative estimate: 40% time savings

- **Value created per worker**: $34,000/year
  - $85,000 × 40% = $34,000 in labor cost savings or redeployment

- **EVOLVE capture rate**: 10% of value created
  - Conservative SaaS pricing: capture 10% of value delivered
  - **Revenue per worker automated**: $3,400/year

**Bottom-Up TAM Validation:**

- 29M target workers × $3,400 revenue per worker
- **Bottom-up TAM: $98.6B annually**

**This validates our top-down TAM of $127B** ✓

The technology spend TAM ($127B) actually understates the opportunity because it doesn't fully account for the labor displacement value. Companies will pay us a fraction of the human labor savings we create.

### **Deep Dive: SMB Customer Service Market (Our Entry Point)**

**The SMB Customer Service Workforce:**

Small and mid-sized businesses with 100-500 employees represent our most attractive entry point. According to US Census Bureau data:

- **200,000 companies** fall into this size category
- 70-85% maintain formal customer service departments
- **150,000 companies with dedicated support functions** = our serviceable addressable market

**Customer Service Staffing at Target SMBs:**

For a typical 200-employee company:

- Customer service teams: 5-10% of total headcount
- **10-20 customer service staff** (conservative midpoint: 14 agents)
- Industry standard: one support agent per 70-100 employees

**Team Structure (15-person team example):**

- **67-73% front-line agents**: Junior and senior representatives handling inquiries
- **7-13% team leads/supervisors**: One supervisor per 12-13 agents
- **7% managers**: Department management
- **Director roles**: Often fractional/shared in this company size

**Compensation Benchmarks:**

Bureau of Labor Statistics (May 2024) data shows:

| Role       | Base Salary      | Fully-Loaded Cost (1.4x) |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Junior Rep | $40,000-$44,000  | $56,000-$62,000          |

| Director   | $90,000-$120,000 | $126,000-$168,000        |

**Fully-loaded cost multiplier of 1.4x** includes:

- Base salary: 100%
- Benefits: 30% (health insurance, retirement, PTO)
- Payroll taxes: 10% (Social Security, Medicare, unemployment)

**Total Customer Service Department Costs (200-employee company):**

Using a realistic 14-person team:

- 5 junior reps @ $58,800 each = $294,000
- 5 senior reps @ $72,000 each = $360,000
- 2 team leads @ $93,600 each = $187,200
- 1 manager @ $115,200 = $115,200
- 0.5 FTE director @ $144,000 = $72,000
- **Total team compensation: $1,028,400**

Additional operational costs:

- Software stack (helpdesk, CRM, phone): $75,000
- Training and development: $28,000
- Allocated overhead (facilities, admin): $70,000
- **Total department cost: $1,201,400 annually**

This represents 4.0% of a $30M revenue company—well within industry benchmarks.

**Automation Potential:**

Multiple research studies (McKinsey, Gartner, Zendesk) converge on:

- **60-70% of customer service work is automatable** using current AI
- Highly automatable tasks (70-90% potential):
  - Password resets, order status, basic product info
  - FAQ responses, ticket routing, data entry
- Moderately automatable (40-60% potential):
  - Basic troubleshooting, refund processing
  - Appointment scheduling, billing inquiries
- Low automation (below 30%):
  - Complex technical issues, escalated complaints
  - Highly customized solutions requiring human empathy

**Real-world results:**

- AI chatbots save **2 hours 20 minutes per agent per day**

- **Net 3-year benefit: $465,000**
- **3-year ROI: 323%**

Even the conservative 40% automation scenario at $1,500/month delivers **489% ROI** with 2-month payback.

### **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $300M ARR by Year 5**

**Our Realistic 5-Year Target:**

Starting from $0.5M ARR in Year 1, reaching $300M ARR by Year 5 represents:

- **~1% of SAM** (conservative for category leader)
- **~0.3% of bottom-up TAM** (extremely conservative)
- **88,000 workers automated** (assuming $3,400 average revenue per worker)

**Why This Is Achievable:**

With our freemium model and SMB-first approach:

- Year 1: 10,000 free users → 500 paid users → $0.5M ARR
- Year 2: 50,000 free users → 5,000 paid users → $5M ARR
- Year 3: 200,000 free users → 20,000 paid users → $20M ARR
- Year 4: 500,000 free users → 50,000 paid users → $100M ARR
- Year 5: 1M free users → 100,000 paid users → $300M ARR

### **Market Segmentation by Company Size**

**Our Target Segments (100-10,000 employees):**

| Segment        | Employee Range | # Companies (US) | Avg Workers per Company | Total Target Workers |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| **SMB**        | 100-500        | 150,000          | 250                     | 37.5M                |
| **Mid-Market** | 500-2,000      | 35,000           | 1,000                   | 35M                  |
| **Enterprise** | 2,000-10,000   | 8,000            | 4,500                   | 36M                  |
| **Total**      | 100-10,000     | 193,000          | -                       | 108.5M               |

**Filtered for Target Roles (Sales, Support, Finance, IT, HR):**

- Target roles represent 27% of total workforce
- **29M workers in our addressable segments**

**Why This Segmentation Matters:**

**SMB (100-500 employees) - Our Entry Point:**

- 150,000 companies in US alone
- Lower compliance friction (faster sales cycles)
- High need for cost efficiency
- Traditional vendors ignore this segment (too expensive to serve)
- **Our advantage**: Freemium model + edge architecture = viable economics

**Mid-Market (500-2,000 employees) - Expansion:**

- 35,000 companies
- Budget for transformation but need proven ROI
- Will follow SMB adoption curve
- Network effects strongest here (peer comparison value)

**Enterprise (2,000-10,000 employees) - Upmarket:**

- 8,000 companies
- Traditional vendor stronghold
- Will demand our solution once proven in SMB/mid-market
- "Why can't we use this if it works for smaller companies?"
- Highest revenue per customer ($500K-$5M+)

**Revenue Potential by Segment (at scale):**

| Segment    | Companies | Penetration | Avg ARR | Revenue Potential |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| SMB        | 150,000   | 5%          | $25K    | $187.5M           |
| Mid-Market | 35,000    | 8%          | $150K   | $420M             |
| Enterprise | 8,000     | 3%          | $1.5M   | $360M             |
| **Total**  | 193,000   | -           | -       | **$967.5M**       |

Our $300M Year 5 target = 31% of this potential (highly achievable)

## **Why This Matters Now**

### **Market Timing**

- **Agent economy emerging** but companies lack infrastructure to participate
- **Process intelligence democratizing** through commodity AI components
- **Freemium SaaS models proven** in adjacent categories (Slack, Figma, Notion)
- **Edge AI becoming viable** with improved local LLM performance
- **SMB digital transformation accelerating** post-pandemic
- **Economic pressure** driving demand for measurable, rapid ROI

### **The SMB Opportunity**

Traditional process mining vendors focused exclusively on enterprise because:

- High implementation costs required large contracts to be viable
- Complex integrations only made sense for sophisticated buyers
- Sales cycles and support requirements too expensive for SMB

**EVOLVE changes the economics:**

- Edge-first architecture eliminates implementation costs
- Freemium eliminates sales cycle friction
- Self-service reduces support burden
- **Can profitably serve the 150,000 SMBs traditional vendors ignore**

This is classic **low-end disruption**: We start where incumbents can't follow (SMB), prove value, build scale and intelligence, then move upmarket with overwhelming advantages.

## **Competitive Advantage: The Unbeatable Moat**

### **We're Playing a Different Game**

| Dimension           | Legacy Vendors (Celonis, UiPath) | Management Consulting (McKinsey) | EVOLVE                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

### **Why Competitors Can't Catch Up**

**Salesforce Apromore** (Timing Consideration for Entry Wedge):

Salesforce acquired Apromore in 2024. Integration timeline: ~12 months. This creates a timing opportunity in our Salesforce entry wedge, but EVOLVE's strategic advantages extend far beyond Salesforce:

**Why we'll succeed regardless of Apromore:**

1. **Independence Advantage**:
   - Customers prefer independent process intelligence layer over platform vendor (Datadog vs AWS, Slack vs Microsoft Teams)
   - EVOLVE works across Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, custom systems—not locked to one platform
   - Apromore will be Salesforce-only, limiting appeal for multi-system companies

2. **SMB Market Segmentation**:
   - Salesforce will target enterprises first (where their revenue is)
   - Our SMB-first approach captures 44,000-51,000 Service Cloud SMBs they'll ignore
   - By the time platform vendors go downmarket, we'll have network effects and established brand

3. **Cross-Platform Network Effects**:
   - Our aggregate intelligence spans multiple platforms (not just Salesforce)
   - Salesforce data siloed per customer; we aggregate patterns across all systems
   - This creates a moat no single platform vendor can replicate

4. **Platform-Agnostic Strategy**:
   - Salesforce is our entry point, not our only market
   - Same model applies to ServiceNow, Zendesk, Microsoft Dynamics, standalone systems
   - Apromore validates the market need but doesn't threaten our broader platform strategy

**Process Mining Vendors** (Celonis $13B, UiPath $12B, SAP Signavio $1.2B):

- Business model requires $100K-500K average deal size
- Enterprise sales org can't economically serve SMB
- Not Salesforce-native (external tools, complex setup)
- Siloed customer data means no cross-company learning
- Discovery-focused with weak transformation execution
- **Can't pivot to Salesforce SMB without destroying economics**

**Salesforce Ecosystem Players:**

_Sales Cloud Focused (Gong, Clari, Outreach):_

- Focus on Sales Cloud, not Service Cloud (different workflows)
- Target mid-market/enterprise, not SMB
- Conversation intelligence, not process intelligence
- No process mining or agent deployment capabilities
- **Wrong product category**

_Service Cloud Process Mining (Hubble, elements.cloud):_

- Lightweight process mining tools on AppExchange
- Limited functionality—basic workflow visualization only
- No transformation execution or agent deployment
- No aggregate intelligence or peer benchmarking
- Non-compelling products with limited adoption
- **Weak competition in our entry market—validates opportunity exists but poorly served**

**Task Mining Vendors** (Soroco $1B+, Kryon/Nintex $3B):

- Expensive specialized sensors limit adoption
- Cloud-based architecture raises security barriers
- Not Salesforce-native
- Static analysis with no aggregate intelligence
- **Can't compete on Salesforce AppExchange distribution**

**RPA Platforms** (UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism):

- Already committed to RPA-first approach (brittle automations)
- Require perfect process definition upfront
- No Salesforce-native integration
- **Wrong architectural foundation for AI agent economy**

**Management Consulting** (McKinsey, Bain, BCG):

- Human-delivered, not scalable
- No network effects or compounding intelligence
- Extremely expensive, enterprise-only
- **Fundamentally incompatible business model**

### **EVOLVE's Compounding Moat**

**1. Data Moat (Compounding over time):**

- **Workflow Intelligence**: Millions of observed workflows across industries, roles, and platforms
- **Pattern Recognition**: Machine learning models trained on aggregate business processes
- **Success Metrics**: Real-world data on which transformations work and which don't
- **Industry Benchmarks**: Peer comparison data that doesn't exist anywhere else
- **Cross-platform insights**: Unique visibility across Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and custom systems
- **Consulting can't compete**: We learn from 10,000+ companies simultaneously; they learn from 50-100 clients

**2. Network Effects (Winner-takes-most):**

- **More users** → More workflow data → Better recommendations & benchmarks
- **Better recommendations** → Higher success rates → More word-of-mouth
- **More deployments** → More learning → Smarter agents
- **Cross-pollination**: Insights from one industry benefit adjacent industries
- **Platform flywheel**: Each new platform integration (Salesforce, ServiceNow, etc.) makes the network stronger

**3. Business Model Moat (Structural advantage):**

- **Freemium motion**: Creates 10-100x more users than enterprise vendors
- **SMB-first economics**: Build scale where competitors can't follow ($20K deals work for us, not them)
- **Per-agent simplicity**: "$375/agent/month" = transparent, calculable, shareable
- **Automated delivery**: Platform scales without linear headcount growth
- **Aggregate intelligence**: Creates switching costs (lose peer benchmarks if you leave)
- **Competitors trapped**: Legacy vendors can't pivot to freemium without destroying revenue

**4. Independence Moat (Customer Preference):**

- **Platform-agnostic architecture**: Works across all major business process platforms
- **Customer trust**: Independent layer preferred over platform vendor control (Datadog vs AWS dynamic)
- **No lock-in fear**: Complements existing systems, doesn't replace them
- **Multi-vendor optionality**: Not dependent on any single platform's roadmap or pricing

**5. Technology Moat (Defensible but commoditizing):**

- **Edge-first architecture**: Privacy-preserving discovery with local LLM inference
- **Multi-layer intelligence**: Across four transformation phases (MINE, DESIGN, DELIVER, MANAGE)
- **Shadow mode validation**: Proves agent effectiveness before production deployment
- **Process digital twin**: Living model of actual workflows, not imagined processes

**6. Entry Market Advantages (Tactical head start):**

- **Salesforce expertise**: Existing relationships and ecosystem knowledge for fast initial traction
- **AppExchange distribution**: Low-CAC customer acquisition ($200-500 vs. $5,000+) in entry market
- **Service Cloud specialization**: Focused beachhead with weak competition (Hubble, elements.cloud)
- **Timing window**: 12-month head start before Salesforce Apromore integration

**The result:** A data and network flywheel that accelerates while competitors stand still. Every new user makes us stronger across all platforms. The gap widens every day, and no single platform vendor can replicate our cross-platform intelligence.

### **Risks & How We Win Against Them**

**We're realistic about competitive threats. Here's how we address the biggest risks:**

**Risk 1: Salesforce bundles Apromore + Agentforce aggressively at enterprise level**

- **Counter-move**: Double down on independence advantage (Datadog vs AWS dynamic)
  - Customers prefer independent Agent Assurance layer that works across Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, custom systems
  - Multi-cloud visibility creates switching costs Apromore can't match (Salesforce-only)
  - Target SMB/mid-market first where Salesforce will focus enterprise buyers
  - By the time Salesforce goes downmarket, we have network effects and installed base

**Risk 2: Microsoft builds agent observability into Copilot Studio natively**

- **Counter-move**: Establish category leadership in Agent Assurance before they recognize the opportunity
  - We're focused 100% on this category; they're building general-purpose agent tooling
  - Our four-layer integration (process + task + org + agent) is unique—they'd need to rebuild from scratch
  - If they eventually build it, we're the acquisition target (proven with Apromore, Signavio, etc.)

**Risk 3: Pure-play AgentOps startup (e.g., LangSmith) beats us to agent observability mindshare**

- **Counter-move**: We have context they don't—process, task, and org intelligence
  - They see agent telemetry in isolation; we connect agent performance to process ROI and org health
  - Our insight: "Agent failed because Salesforce flow X conflicts with rule Y" vs. their "Agent failed"
  - Our peer benchmarking and Transformation Score are impossible without cross-company data at scale

**Risk 4: Celonis/UiPath pivot to freemium and SMB**

- **Counter-move**: Structural impossibility—would destroy their revenue model
  - $100K-500K average deal size → $10K-50K requires 90% cost reduction
  - Enterprise sales org, consultant dependencies, cloud architecture all wrong for SMB
  - Even if they try, we'll have 2+ year head start and SMB network effects by then
  - History: No enterprise software vendor has successfully pivoted to SMB disruption

**The Common Thread:** Our advantages compound over time (network effects, Transformation Score adoption, cross-platform data). The longer we execute, the wider the moat becomes.

- Agent opportunity identification and ROI projections
- Basic benchmarking against aggregate data
- **Business Purpose**: Drive maximum adoption, especially in SMB
- **User Value**: "See what's possible before you pay"
- **Strategic Goal**: 100,000+ free users contributing to aggregate intelligence

**Paid Tier 1: Monetize Transformation ($500-$50K/month)**

- DESIGN phase: AI-powered transformation roadmaps (trained on aggregate data)
- DELIVER phase: Autonomous agent authoring and deployment
- Token-based consumption pricing (pay only when agents work)
- Shadow mode testing and validation
- Detailed peer comparison and industry benchmarks
- Basic reporting and monitoring
- **Business Purpose**: Capture value from transformation execution
- **User Value**: "Pay only when agents deliver value"
- **Typical Customer**: SMB to mid-market
- **Strategic Goal**: 30-40% free-to-paid conversion over 12 months

**Paid Tier 2: Enterprise Platform ($50K-$500K+/month)**

- MANAGE phase: Full service assurance and continuous improvement
- Enterprise governance console
- Advanced analytics and executive reporting
- Multi-team synthesis and optimization
- Custom industry benchmarking reports
- Priority support and custom integrations
- **Business Purpose**: High-margin enterprise expansion revenue
- **User Value**: "Transform your entire organization continuously"
- **Typical Customer**: Mid-market to enterprise
- **Strategic Goal**: 10-15% of Tier 1 customers expand to Tier 2

### **Why This Model Wins**

**Versus Legacy Mining Vendors:**

- They sell mining at $100K-500K per deployment → limited adoption, enterprise-only
- We give mining free → 100x more users → massive aggregate intelligence advantage
- They monetize discovery → we monetize transformation (10x more valuable)
- They ignore SMB → we dominate SMB, then move upmarket

**Versus Freemium SaaS Competitors:**

- Most freemium tools have weak network effects (documents, projects)
- Our network effects are structural—every workflow makes platform smarter
- Data moat compounds faster than feature moat
- Benchmarking value increases with user base

**Versus Enterprise Software:**

- No large upfront sales cycle → faster time-to-value
- Self-service adoption → capital efficient scaling
- Usage-based pricing → aligned incentives
- SMB-friendly pricing → access to 150,000 ignored companies

### **Revenue Model Economics**

**Typical Customer Journey by Segment:**

**SMB (100-500 employees):**

- **Month 1-2**: Free (discovery produces "wow" moment)
- **Month 3-6**: $500-$2,500/month (first agents deployed)
- **Month 6-12**: $2,500-$10,000/month (team-wide adoption)
- **Year 2+**: $10,000-$50,000/month (continuous transformation)

**Mid-Market (500-2,000 employees):**

- **Month 1-2**: Free (multiple departments discover value)
- **Month 3-6**: $5,000-$15,000/month (coordinated deployment)
- **Month 6-12**: $15,000-$75,000/month (cross-functional adoption)
- **Year 2+**: $75,000-$200,000/month (enterprise platform features)

**Enterprise (2,000-10,000 employees):**

- **Month 1-6**: Free (extensive proof of value across org)
- **Month 6-12**: $50,000-$150,000/month (strategic deployment)
- **Year 2+**: $200,000-$1,000,000/month (organization-wide transformation)

**Revenue Multipliers:**

1. **SMB volume**: 150,000 companies we can reach (vs. 8,000 enterprises)
2. **Network leverage**: More free users = better product = higher conversion
3. **Usage expansion**: More agents = more token consumption
4. **Peer benchmarking value**: Increases with user base size
5. **Upmarket movement**: SMB success drives mid-market and enterprise demand
6. **Expansion revenue**: Free → Paid Tier 1 → Paid Tier 2 natural progression
7. **Reduced churn**: Continuous improvement + peer insights = lock-in

**Unit Economics (at scale):**

- **CAC**:
  - SMB: $100-300 (freemium + product-led growth)
  - Mid-Market: $500-1,500 (light-touch sales)
  - Enterprise: $2,000-5,000 (traditional sales, but inbound)
- **LTV**:
  - SMB: $25,000-75,000 (3-4 year retention)
  - Mid-Market: $150,000-400,000 (4-5 year retention)
  - Enterprise: $500,000-$2,000,000 (5+ year retention)
- **LTV:CAC**:
  - SMB: 80-250:1 (exceptional)
  - Mid-Market: 100-300:1 (exceptional)
  - Enterprise: 100-400:1 (exceptional)
- **Gross Margin**: 80-85% (edge compute reduces infrastructure costs)
- **Payback Period**: 2-4 months (freemium model)
- **Net Dollar Retention**:
  - SMB: 110-120% (some churn, moderate expansion)
  - Mid-Market: 130-150% (strong expansion)
  - Enterprise: 140-180% (very strong expansion)
- **Viral Coefficient**: 0.5-0.8 (peer recommendations, benchmarking sharing)

### **The Fleet Economics**

**Cost Structure Innovation:**

- Edge processing → 70-80% reduction in compute costs vs. cloud
- Freemium → acquisition cost near zero for SMB
- Aggregate intelligence → product improves automatically
- Self-service → minimal sales and support costs for SMB/mid-market

**Revenue Structure:**

- Free tier: 0% of revenue, 100% of aggregate intelligence value
- Paid Tier 1: 70-75% of revenue (volume play, especially SMB)
- Paid Tier 2: 25-30% of revenue (highest margins, enterprise)

**The Magic:**

- Free SMB users cost almost nothing (edge compute)
- But create enormous value (workflow intelligence, benchmarks)
- Paid SMB users provide volume revenue
- Mid-market and enterprise monetize the aggregate intelligence at premium prices
- Every free user increases paid user LTV through better benchmarks

## **Go-to-Market Strategy: SMB-First, Platform Expansion**

### **Our Tactical Entry Point: Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs**

To prove the model and build momentum quickly, we're starting with **Salesforce Service Cloud SMBs**—a market we know well, where we can move fast, and where competition is weak or slow.

**Why This Entry Point:**

1. **We have existing customers and relationships**: Deep Salesforce ecosystem knowledge and Service Cloud experience
2. **Salesforce sellers become advocates**: They need tools to create clear value and unstick prospects; they've struggled with AgentForce value selling; EVOLVE provides the independent validation layer they need
3. **We can land quickly**: AppExchange provides low-CAC distribution ($200-500 vs $5,000+), <1 day deployment
4. **Timing window**: Salesforce acquired Apromore—we have ~12 months to establish position before their integration
5. **Weak competition**: Current Salesforce process mining players (Hubble, elements.cloud) have lightweight, non-compelling products
6. **Underserved SMB segment**: 44,000-51,000 Service Cloud SMB customers ignored by enterprise vendors
7. **Clear value prop**: $350-400 per agent per month = simple ROI calculation

**The Entry Wedge:**

- **90,000-105,000 Salesforce Service Cloud customers** with 1.2-1.5M service agents
- **$5.4B TAM** within Service Cloud alone
- Prove model with SMBs → Expand to mid-market/enterprise → Apply playbook to ServiceNow, Zendesk, Microsoft Dynamics, standalone systems

**This is a tactical entry point, not our strategic positioning.** Salesforce gives us a beachhead to prove transformation at scale with modern business model. Once proven, the same playbook applies across any business process platform.

---

### **Phase 1: Salesforce Service Cloud SMB Entry (Year 1-2)**

**Objective: Prove model with 1-7% penetration of Salesforce Service Cloud SMB market ($8M-71M ARR)**

**AppExchange Freemium Execution:**

- Waze (Google): Acquired for $1.3B (map network effects)
- **Our parallel**: Workflow intelligence network effects + peer benchmarking

**Our Wedge:**

- Traditional vendors sell to 8,000 enterprises at $100K-500K each
- EVOLVE sells to 150,000 SMBs + 35,000 mid-market + 8,000 enterprises
- We reach 24x more companies with freemium + network effects
- We capture labor savings value (not just software spend)
- **Result**: Larger revenue opportunity + stronger moat + premium valuation

### **The Unique Investment Thesis**

**This is not a "better process mining" investment.**

**This is a low-end disruption + network effects platform play:**

- Start where incumbents can't compete (SMB)
- Build massive user base with freemium economics
- Create compounding data moat from aggregate intelligence
- Provide peer insights no one else can (benchmarking advantage)
- Move upmarket with overwhelming competitive advantages
- Dominate category through winner-takes-most dynamics

**The opportunity:**

- The SMB process intelligence market doesn't exist (created by us)
- The peer benchmarking data doesn't exist (created by our network)
- The work automation network doesn't exist yet (we're building it)
- Whoever builds it first owns the category

---

## **The Ask**

**We're raising $2-3M in seed extension funding to execute the SMB disruption playbook and build unassailable market position.**

This capital will enable us to:

- Build and scale the edge-first mining platform optimized for SMB

- Prove 30%+ free-to-paid conversion in SMB segment
- Develop peer benchmarking and industry comparison capabilities
- Launch paid tiers and achieve $1.5M MRR
- Position for strong Series A ($6M+ ARR, clear path to $50M ARR)

**Why invest now:**

**Timing**: Window to build SMB user base before competitors understand the model

**Market**: $127B technology TAM + $98B labor savings TAM, but we're starting where nobody else can compete

**Disruption**: Classic low-end disruption playbook proven by Atlassian, Zoom, Shopify

**Network Effects**: True winner-takes-most dynamics through aggregate intelligence and peer benchmarking

**Business Model**: Proven freemium playbook + structural cost advantages + SMB economics

**Team**: Technical depth in edge AI, aggregate intelligence systems, and SMB go-to-market

**Traction**: Clear 18-month path to Series A with measurable milestones by segment

**The opportunity:** Just as Tesla built a fleet that made every car smarter, and Waze built a network that made every driver smarter, we're building a network that makes every business transformation more successful.

Every company—from 100-employee SMBs to 10,000-employee enterprises—will need to transform continuously. We're building the platform that makes that possible, starting where the incumbents can't follow, and capturing the peer intelligence that doesn't exist anywhere else.

**We're not disrupting process mining. We're democratizing business transformation and creating a new category: peer-powered process intelligence.**

- Sales model: Enterprise field sales ($50K+ cost per customer)
- Implementation: Requires consultants and integration partners
- Cloud architecture: Security concerns, high compute costs
- **Economics simply don't work at $10K-50K deal sizes**

**Startups Can't Build Network Fast Enough:**

- Network effects require massive scale
- Need years to accumulate workflow intelligence
- First mover advantage in SMB market
- We're building the network now—by the time they try, insurmountable lead

**Tech Giants Could (But Won't):**

- Microsoft, Salesforce, Google could build networks
- But SMB process mining isn't strategic to their core
- Would require dedicated go-to-market and product focus
- Acquisition more likely than build (we're the acquisition target)

### **The Disruption Timeline**

**Year 1: SMB Dominance**

- EVOLVE: 50,000 SMB users, network effects visible, $1-2M ARR
- Competitors: Unaware or dismissive ("SMB isn't our market")

**Year 2: Mid-Market Threat**

- EVOLVE: 200,000 users, mid-market traction, $10-20M ARR, peer benchmarking = killer feature
- Competitors: Beginning to understand threat, attempting SMB plays (failing due to cost structure)

**Year 3: Enterprise Encroachment**

- EVOLVE: 500,000+ users, enterprise wins, $50-100M ARR, category leader
- Competitors: Attempting network strategies (too late, can't change business model), acquisition discussions

**Year 4-5: Category Ownership**

- EVOLVE: 1-2M users, $200-300M ARR, de facto standard for SMB/mid-market, strong enterprise presence
- Competitors: Acquisition or irrelevance

**The result**: EVOLVE becomes the work automation platform across all segments. We own the SMB and mid-market categories entirely, and compete strongly in enterprise with overwhelming advantages from scale, aggregate intelligence, and peer benchmarking capabilities.
