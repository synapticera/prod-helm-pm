## SLIDE 1: The Problem

### Companies Face a Transformation Crisis

**The Market is Broken:**

**For SMBs (150,000 companies):**

- Process mining costs $100K-500K (completely priced out)
- Flying blind on automation opportunities
- No competitive intelligence about peer performance
- Manual processes eating 30-40% of productivity

**For Mid-Market & Enterprise:**

- Legacy vendors sell expensive mining, but no execution
- Siloed implementations with no cross-company learning
- No peer benchmarking or industry intelligence
- Static analysis that becomes outdated immediately

**The Question No One Can Answer:**

> "How do my processes compare to peers, and where should I focus for maximum ROI?"

## SLIDE 2: The EVOLVE Solution

### The First End-to-End Process Transformation Platform

**Four Integrated Phases:**

**1. MINE (FREE)** → Edge-first workflow discovery  
Privacy-preserving, instant value, zero security concerns

**2. DESIGN** → AI-powered transformation roadmaps  
Informed by aggregate patterns from thousands of companies

**3. DELIVER** → Autonomous agent authoring  
Shadow mode validation, continuous learning

**4. MANAGE** → Continuous improvement  
Real-time peer benchmarking, service assurance

**The Result:** From discovery to deployed agents to continuous optimization—all powered by network intelligence that doesn't exist anywhere else.

## SLIDE 3: The Tesla Parallel

### We're Democratizing Process Intelligence

| **Tesla's Innovation**                 | **EVOLVE's Innovation**                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Commodity cameras vs. LIDAR            | Commodity LLMs vs. specialized sensors          |
| Edge processing in vehicles            | Edge-first architecture on devices              |
| Fleet learning makes every car smarter | Aggregate learning makes every customer smarter |
| Freemium features drove adoption       | Freemium discovery drives massive adoption      |

**The Result:**  
What was enterprise-only ($500K+) becomes accessible to any company from 100-10,000 employees.

**The Moat:**  
Network effects through aggregate workflow intelligence and peer benchmarking create winner-takes-most dynamics.

**Bottom-Up: Labor Savings TAM**

- 29M target knowledge workers in automatable roles
- $85K average fully-loaded cost per worker
- 40% automation potential = $34K value created per worker
- We capture 10% = $3,400 revenue per worker
- **Bottom-up TAM: $98.6B annually**

**Our Wedge: 150,000 SMBs Completely Ignored by Incumbents**

---

## SLIDE 5: Why We Win - SMB First

### Classic Low-End Disruption Playbook

**Market Structure:**

- **150,000 SMBs** (100-500 employees)
- vs. 35,000 mid-market
- vs. 8,000 enterprises
- **19x more companies in SMB than enterprise**

**Why Incumbents Can't Compete:**

- Require $100K-500K deals to cover costs
- Enterprise field sales costs $50K+ per customer
- **SMB economics don't work for them**

**Our Advantages:**

- Freemium = near-zero CAC ($100-300 vs. their $50K+)
- Edge architecture = 70-80% lower compute costs
- Product-led growth = viral adoption
- Network effects = compounding moat
- **We own 150,000 companies they ignore**

**The Path:**  
SMB (prove) → Mid-Market (scale) → Enterprise (dominate)

## SLIDE 6: Competitive Landscape

### We're Playing a Different Game

| Dimension        | Legacy Vendors                | **EVOLVE**                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Product**      | Mining technology (expensive) | **Mining is free, monetize transformation** |
| **Market**       | Enterprise-only (8K)          | **SMB-first (150K), then upmarket**         |
| **Pricing**      | $100K-500K                    | **Freemium → $500-50K/month**               |
| **Distribution** | Enterprise sales              | **Product-led growth**                      |
| **Intelligence** | Siloed per customer           | **Aggregate learning**                      |
| **Moat**         | Technology (commoditizing)    | **Network effects (compounding)**           |

**Key Insight:**  
Celonis ($13B) and UiPath ($12B) can't pivot to SMB without destroying their business model. **By the time they try, we have insurmountable network effects lead.**

**Comparable Success:**

- Atlassian: SMB → Enterprise, $50B valuation

## SLIDE 13: Why Network Effects Win

### The Compounding Intelligence Moat

**The Flywheel:**

1. **More Users** → More workflow data captured (anonymously)

2. **More Data** → Better peer benchmarks and recommendations

3. **Better Benchmarks** → Higher free-to-paid conversion

4. **More Paid Customers** → More agent deployments and learning

5. **More Deployments** → Smarter agents and success patterns

6. **Better Outcomes** → Word-of-mouth and viral growth

7. **More Users** → Cycle accelerates...

**The Moat Deepens:**

- Every free user contributes to aggregate intelligence (costs us almost nothing)
- Peer benchmarking data doesn't exist anywhere else
- Switching costs increase (lose access to peer insights)
- Later entrants start years behind in aggregate learning
- **Winner-takes-most market dynamics**

**Comparable Network Effect Winners:**

- Figma: Design network effects, $20B acquisition (50x revenue)
- Waze: Map network effects, $1.3B acquisition (Google)
- Snowflake: Data network effects, 168% NDR, $70B valuation
