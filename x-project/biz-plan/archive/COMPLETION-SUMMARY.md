## 💡 Key Strategic Narratives

### Narrative 1: "We Called It First"

**Timeline:** Thesis 6 months ago → Industry validation happening now
**Validation Sources:** Ed Sim (Issue #479), Gartner (DI #1 trend), Forrester (Agent Control Planes)
**Investor Hook:** Category ownership + first-mover advantage + FOMO

### Narrative 2: "Market is Crystallizing NOW"

**Inflection Point:** 40% of enterprise apps getting agents by 2026 (Gartner)
**Problem:** 33% of deployments failing (no decision context)
**Regulatory Tailwind:** EU AI Act compliance required August 2, 2026
**Opportunity Window:** Limited time before incumbents catch on

### Narrative 3: "Why We're Not Repeating Vibes Coding Miss"

- **Issue #1:** Wrong tech stack (SFI dependent → AI-native independent)
- **Issue #2:** Wrong team (past-focused → future-focused)
- **Issue #3:** Lack of conviction (incremental → bold, all-in)
- **Issue #4:** Lean startup vs blitz (learning → execution speed)

### Narrative 4: "Unique Competitive Position"

**Helm's Sweet Spot:** High Decision Intelligence + Low Enterprise CAC
**Legacy Vendors:** High DI but trapped in $100K+ enterprise model
**Incumbents:** High maturity but low DI, not service-focused
**Helm Advantage:** 150K SMBs + freemium model + vertical specialization
