## Elevator Pitches

### Current (DI for CS)

> "Helm is the Decision Intelligence Platform for Customer Service. We help AI agents and customer service teams understand every decision they make, govern which actions run autonomously, and achieve compliance at scale. Starting with freemium, expanding through enterprise add-ons."

### Dan's (Work Elevation)

> "Helm is the Work Elevation Platform. We observe how knowledge workers actually work, learn patterns across thousands of completions, and help AI agents earn autonomy through demonstrated competence—starting with customer service, expanding to all enterprise automation."

### Hybrid (Recommended)

> "Helm is the Work Elevation Platform for Customer Service. We observe how customer service teams and AI agents work, learn patterns, govern decisions, and transform operators into orchestrators. As agents replace 40% of human work, our observation and governance layer becomes essential enterprise infrastructure."

**Q3: What's our competitive advantage stronger in?**

- **Observation data network effects** → Dan's approach
- **Decision data network effects** → Current approach
- **Both** → Hybrid combines them

**Q4: What's our timeline comfort?**

- **12-18 months to Series A** → Current or Hybrid
- **18-24 months OK** → Dan's is viable

**Q5: What's investor appetite?**

- **Vertical + category ownership** → Current or Hybrid
- **Horizontal infrastructure** → Dan's

## Recommendation Summary

**The Hybrid approach balances:**

- ✅ Current's faster GTM (freemium, Series A velocity)
- ✅ Dan's larger TAM ($50B upside)
- ✅ Both moats (observation + decision data)
- ✅ De-risked path (prove CS first, expand to horizontal)
- ✅ Investor appeal (growth + vision)

**Positioning:**

> "Work Elevation Platform for Customer Service"

**Series A Story:**

> "We proved observation-driven governance works in customer service (fastest AI adoption, highest agent failure rate). Now we're expanding the model to all enterprise automation. TAM progression: $2-3B (CS) → $50B+ (all enterprise)."
