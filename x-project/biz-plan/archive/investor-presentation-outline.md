## Helm by Synaptic - Seed Extension Round

**Updated:** January 2, 2026 - Aligned with Latest Messaging (Dec 2025 AARP Pitch)

---

## 1. Opening & Vision (1 slide)

- [ ] Company name: **Helm by Synaptic**
- [ ] Tagline: "AI-Native Executive Command Center for Customer Service Leaders"
- [ ] One-sentence value proposition: **"Helm is the AI command center that shows customer service leaders what they can't see — so they can act on what matters."**
- [ ] Bold vision: "Give service leaders full command across domains and horizons to evolve their operations with confidence and impact"
- [ ] Founder name(s) and title(s)
- [ ] Confidentiality statement: "Private and Confidential. Property of Synaptic Era, Inc ©2025"

---

## 2. The Problem (2 slides)

### Slide 2a: No One Has "Full Command"

- [ ] **Problem Statement:** CS executives face blind spots across two critical dimensions:
  - **Horizons:** Short-term operations vs. long-term strategy disconnect
  - **Domains:** Siloed view across Systems, Process, Data, Team, Financials
- [ ] **Root Cause:** Gap between operational tools and strategic decision-making
- [ ] **Target Customer:** Customer service executives and leaders navigating AI transformation
- [ ] **Why Now:** AI is transforming customer service, but leaders lack the command layer to connect the dots
- [ ] **Visual:** 2x2 grid showing Horizons (short/long-term) vs Domains (5 dimensions)

### Slide 2b: The AI ROI Crisis

- [ ] **95%** of AI pilots deliver zero ROI (MIT)
- [ ] **85%** of AI projects fail before proving value (Gartner)
- [ ] **78%** using AI see no bottom-line impact (McKinsey)
- [ ] **Why Projects Fail:** Powerful AI transformation requires **broad command** to connect the dots across domains and over time
- [ ] **Common Trouble Spots:**
  - ROI model, roadmap & measure (need ground truth, vision, roadmap, measure)
  - Tech selection & roadmap (need ground truth, vision, roadmap, measure)
  - Impact of change (understanding vs. implementing)
- [ ] **The Gap:** No one has the full command they need to succeed

---

## 3. The Solution (2-3 slides)

### Slide 3a: Helm Product Overview

- [ ] **High-Level:** "An AI-native executive command center that gives service leaders the tailored insight they need to evolve their operations with confidence and impact"
- [ ] **Key Concept:** Not execution tools - decision intelligence layer that sits above CRM, ticketing, workforce management
- [ ] **How AI-Native Makes It Different:**
  - Speed of Integration (natural language data mapping)
  - Adaptability (self-learning, expert-in-the-loop)
  - Depth of Insight (cross-domain synthesis)
  - Direct Link to Execution (spec & code generation)
- [ ] **Visual:** Command center diagram showing Helm layer above operational tools

### Slide 3b: Four-Module Transformation Journey

- [ ] **Explore (Free):** AI in CS primer, benchmarks, best practices, Q&A with Helm agent
- [ ] **Mine (Paid One-Time):** Map operations (Systems, Process, Data, Team, Financials), analyze current state, establish baseline
- [ ] **Design (Paid One-Time):** Define future state, propose roadmap options & tradeoffs, create detailed program plan
- [ ] **Manage (Subscription):** Continuous monitoring, real-time alerts, ongoing improvement, recommendations
- [ ] **Key Benefit:** Guided transformation from exploration to continuous improvement
- [ ] **Visual:** Four-phase flow diagram with pricing model labels

### Slide 3c: How It Works (AI-Native Architecture)

- [ ] **Data Ingest:** Multi-source (Salesforce, documents, video, audio), natural language prompts
- [ ] **AI Analysis:** Expert-in-the-loop, feedback loop, self-learning templates
- [ ] **Dynamic UX:** Personalized UI, desktop observation, natural language interface (voice & chat)
- [ ] **Execution Link:** Spec generation, code generation from natural language
- [ ] **Why AI Is Essential:** Traditional tools can't synthesize across domains, can't learn from usage, require technical skills
- [ ] **Visual:** Architecture diagram showing AI components and data flow
