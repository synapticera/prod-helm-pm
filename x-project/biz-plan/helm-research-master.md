**File**: `x-project/reference/market-research/2026-01-05-MIT-CISR-Enterprise-AI-Maturity-Model-Summary.md`
**Date**: January 5, 2026 (Research from 2024-2025)
**Sample Size**: 721 companies + 9 in-depth case studies
**Key Stats**:

- Stage 2 (Pilots): 34% stuck; -3.5pp growth, -2.2pp profit vs industry
- Stage 3 (Scale Operations): 46% (up from 31% in 2022); +11.3pp growth, +8.7pp profit
- **Financial inflection**: +24pp profitability swing from Stage 2→3
- **For $500M company**: $120M additional profit impact

**Key Finding**: Stage 2→3 transition requires solving the executive function layer (exactly what Helm does)

**Relevance**: Directly validates Helm's positioning as addressing the critical constraint that separates winners from those stuck in pilots

**How to Use**:

- Investor pitch: "MIT shows $120M profit impact swing at the Stage 2→3 transition"
- Market sizing: "34% of enterprises in Stage 2 (pilot phase) = our addressable market"
- TAM calculation: "$1T+ productivity opportunity, with Helm capturing governance layer value"

#### 7. McKinsey State of AI 2025

**File**: `x-project/reference/market-research/2026-01-05-McKinsey-State-of-AI-2025-Summary.md`
**Date**: January 5, 2026 (Research from November 2025)
**Sample**: Broad enterprise survey
**Key Stats**:

- 88% using AI regularly; only 39% seeing EBIT impact (61% gap)
- 23% scaling agentic systems; 39% experimenting; 38% not engaged
- **Critical finding**: Workflow redesign has biggest effect on EBIT impact
- High performers 3x more likely to scale agents; 3x more likely to have aligned leadership
- Risk management escalating: companies managing 2x more risks (2022→2025)

**Key Finding**: EBIT gap exists because companies deploy agents without redesigning workflows around them

**Relevance**: Validates Helm's Design module as essential for capturing enterprise-level ROI

**How to Use**:

- Service leader pitch: "McKinsey proves workflow redesign is #1 success factor—that's what our Design module does"
- Investor pitch: "39% EBIT impact vs 88% deployment = $billions market for solutions closing this gap"

- Target: Scale to ~50% of tech spending on agents (5-10 years)
- Critical gaps: data access, interoperability (MCP), DevOps evolution

**Key Finding**: Governance and decision intelligence must be foundational, not retrofitted

**Relevance**: Validates Helm's governance-first architecture and domain-specialization strategy

**How to Use**:

- Investor pitch: "Bain shows 5-10% of tech budgets flowing to agentic AI for 3-5 years = consistent market"

**Purpose**: Cross-vendor validation showing three independent sources converging on same insights

**Key Validation Points**:

1. Enterprise AI scaling is stalled (~33% have moved beyond pilots)
2. Governance & decision intelligence are foundational (not optional)
3. Workflow redesign is critical success factor
4. Regulatory tailwind (EU AI Act) creating urgency
5. Market timing is NOW (2026 inflection)

### Analyst Research

#### 10. Gartner: Decision Intelligence as #1 2026 Emerging Trend

**Source**: Gartner Hype Cycle for AI 2025/2026
**Date**: 2025-2026
**Definition**: "Decision Intelligence is the engineering discipline of how decisions are made"
**Approach**: Composite AI combining LLMs (probabilistic) with knowledge graphs + rules (symbolic) for safety

**Relevance**: Formal analyst category validation. (Note: User is reconsidering primary positioning from "Decision Intelligence" to "Executive Agent"—this remains important as supporting technical language)

**How to Use**:

- Analyst briefings: Establish credibility as knowledge domain
- Supporting narrative: "What Gartner calls Decision Intelligence, we implement as Executive Agent"

---

#### 7. Forrester: Agent Control Planes & Governance Infrastructure

**Source**: Forrester Research
**Date**: 2025-2026
**Framework**: 3-plane architecture—Build Plane (agents) → Orchestration Plane (work) → Control Plane (governance)
**Key Finding**: "You cannot trust agents to police themselves; need external governance layer"

**Relevance**: Analyst validation of governance/control positioning

**How to Use**:

- Analyst briefings: "Forrester calls this Control Plane; we call it Manage module"
- Competitive positioning: Against agents, we provide the control layer they lack

---

### Customer & Internal Validation

#### 8. Customer Conversations (Triple Validation - Practitioners)

**Sources**: Direct conversations with:

- **Mike** (VP Service): "Our agents are breaking things we don't understand. We need someone to help us see what's happening and course-correct."
- **Shibohn** (Director of AI, enterprise retail): "We built an agent last quarter. Nobody wants to use it because the team doesn't trust it. We need transparency and buy-in."
- **Colby** (Chief Service Officer, financial services): "33% of our AI pilots failed. Not because the AI wasn't smart. Because we didn't have a clear governance model and the team rejected it."
- **Mark** (VP Customer Operations, SaaS): "I have decision traces in my logs but no way to learn from them. That's our competitive advantage we're leaving on the table."

**Key Pattern**: Urgent need for agent governance + transparency. Not "nice-to-have"—actively looking right now.

**Relevance**: Ground-truth validation that the problem is real and urgent

**How to Use**:

- Investor pitch: "We don't have to convince anyone this is real. Our customers are asking for it."
- Positioning: Validates "Executive Agent" language—leaders need "executive function" for agent management

---

#### 9. Internal Product Evidence (Triple Validation - Our Own Products)

**Observations**:

- **MAX (Synaptic customer success platform)**: Deployed agents for workflow automation; immediately hit management problem. "Agents are making decisions we can't explain to customers."
- **Claude Code (VS Code plugin)**: Developers want to understand how Claude is making code decisions, have visibility, course-correct
- **Daily Product Development**: Teams deploying agents and running into management constraint in real-time

**Key Pattern**: Management constraint is happening NOW in our own org

**Relevance**: Internal proof that thesis is real and timing is right

**How to Use**:

- Investor pitch: "If we're seeing this internally, market will see it soon. We're ahead of it."
- Positioning: Validates urgency and market inflection
