## Slide Content

### Header

- **Source**: McKinsey State of AI 2025
- **Title**: The Workflow Redesign Imperative
- **Subtitle**: Why 88% Deployment ≠ Enterprise ROI

### Left Section: Key Statistics

1. **88%** - Organizations Using AI
   - Regular AI use in at least one business function
   - +10pp increase from 2024

2. **23%** - Scaling Agentic Systems
   - Production-level deployment across functions
   - Organizations actually achieving results

3. **39%** - Experimenting with Agents
   - Pilot phase (where most organizations are stuck)

### Right Section: The Critical Insights

**The Business Impact Gap**

- **88% → 39%**: Deployment Rate vs. Enterprise EBIT Impact
- A 49-point gap representing billions in unrealized ROI
- This is the market Helm captures

**McKinsey's Critical Finding**

> "Workflow redesign has the biggest effect on an organization's ability to see EBIT impact from gen AI"

**Helm Validation**

- Helm's Mine/Design/Manage framework is built to close this gap
- Understand operations → Redesign workflows → Execute with governance → Prove ROI

### Footer

- High performers 3x more likely to scale agents (requires executive alignment + organizational commitment)
- McKinsey November 2025 | Helm Strategic Positioning

## Why This Slide Is Gold

### The Problem Statement

- **88% adoption** - Companies are buying AI solutions
- **39% ROI** - But only 39% see enterprise-level EBIT impact
- **The Gap** - 49 percentage points of unrealized value

### The Root Cause (McKinsey)

Companies deploy agents as point solutions but skip the critical step: **workflow redesign**. Without redesign, gains remain isolated and don't compound to enterprise ROI.

### The Helm Solution

This slide visually proves that Helm's three-module approach (Mine/Design/Manage) directly addresses McKinsey's identified success factor: systematic workflow redesign paired with governance and measurement.

### Who This Resonates With

- **Service Leaders**: "We deployed agents. We're in that 39%. How do we get to enterprise ROI?"
- **CFOs**: "61% of companies deploying aren't seeing ROI. Why?"
- **Investors**: "McKinsey validates the market exists. Helm is the solution."
- **Analysts**: "This is the next market opportunity in AI infrastructure."
