# Services Business: Buyer Cultivation Strategy

**Context**: RS is currently "just an idea" — needs cultivation, not immediate execution
**Objective**: Position services business for optimal sale when strategic timing is right
**Timeline**: 12-18 month cultivation; ready to transact within 6 months of decision

---

## Why Cultivate Buyers Now

Even if you're not selling immediately, buyer cultivation:

1. **Creates optionality** — You know what's possible when you need it
2. **Informs valuation** — Real buyer interest validates your assumptions
3. **Improves business** — Buyer diligence highlights fixable weaknesses
4. **Reduces transaction time** — Pre-built relationships accelerate deals

## RS Buyer Assessment

Since RS is "just an idea," answer these questions before pursuing:

### Due Diligence Questions

**Strategic Fit**:

1. What is RS's current Salesforce practice size?
2. What's their AI/agent capability today?
3. What geography/industry focus do they have?
4. What's their acquisition history?
5. Are they PE-backed or independent?

**Financial Capacity**:

1. What deal sizes have they done before?
2. Do they have acquisition capital available?
3. What's their typical deal structure (cash/earnout/equity)?
4. Who are decision-makers for M&A?

**Relationship Quality**:

1. Do you have existing relationships with RS leadership?
2. Have you worked together before (partnerships, referrals)?
3. What's their reputation in the market?

### Outreach Approach for RS

**If Warm Connection Exists**:

> "Hey [Name], I've been thinking about the market and noticed [RS] doing interesting work in [area]. We've built something special at [Company]—strong AI practice, great team. Not selling tomorrow, but curious if you ever think about strategic options. Worth a coffee?"

**If Cold/Network Introduction Needed**:

1. Identify common connections (LinkedIn, Salesforce ecosystem)
2. Get warm introduction through partner channel
3. Position as "market intelligence" conversation, not sales

**What NOT to Do**:

- Don't signal desperation
- Don't lead with "we're for sale"
- Don't share confidential information early
- Don't skip due diligence on them

## Deal Structure Considerations

### Typical Deal Structures

| ---------------- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| **All Cash**     | 100%         | 0%      | None      | Rare for $4M     |
| **Mostly Cash**  | 70-80%       | 20-30%  | 12-24 mo  | Common           |
| **Balanced**     | 50-60%       | 40-50%  | 24-36 mo  | PE typical       |
| **Equity Heavy** | 30-40%       | Stock   | 36+ mo    | Strategic        |

### Your Priorities

Based on Strategic Leverage strategy, rank your priorities:

1. **Maximum cash at close** — Enables product funding
2. **Short earnout** — Minimizes distraction from product

4. **Transition support** — Team continuation without you

### Negotiation Leverage Points

**Strengthens Your Position**:

- Multiple interested buyers
- Strong growth trajectory
- Unique AI capabilities
- Clean financials
- Committed team
- No urgency to sell

**Weakens Your Position**:

- Single buyer interest
- Declining revenue

## Transaction Timeline

Once you decide to sell, expect:

| Phase             | Duration       | Activities                              |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Preparation**   | 4-6 weeks      | Data room, advisor selection, materials |
| **Marketing**     | 4-8 weeks      | Buyer outreach, initial meetings        |
| **LOI**           | 2-4 weeks      | Term negotiation, exclusivity           |
| **Due Diligence** | 6-10 weeks     | Financial, legal, operational review    |
| **Documentation** | 4-6 weeks      | Purchase agreement, ancillary docs      |
| **Closing**       | 1-2 weeks      | Funding, signatures, announcements      |
| **TOTAL**         | **5-8 months** |                                         |

**To Accelerate**:

- Pre-built buyer relationships
- Data room ready in advance
- Clean books and records
- Advisor already engaged

---

## Advisory Support

### When to Engage an Advisor

**Advantages of Advisor**:

- Confidentiality (you're not "in market")
- Broader buyer reach
- Valuation expertise
- Negotiation support
- Process management

**Disadvantages**:

- Cost (5-8% of deal value = $400K-$700K)
- Less control
- Timeline may lengthen

**Recommendation**: For a $8-12M deal, consider:

- DIY for friendly deals (like RS if relationship is strong)
- Advisor for competitive process or if you need top dollar

### Advisors to Consider

**Salesforce Ecosystem Specialists**:

- Solganick & Company (Salesforce M&A focus)
- Tequity Advisors (mentioned in research)

**Lower Middle Market Generalists**:

- Vista Point Advisors
- Capstone Partners
- Lincoln International

## Action Items: Next 90 Days

### Immediate (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Research RS thoroughly — answer due diligence questions
- [ ] Map 10 additional potential buyers
- [ ] Review recent Salesforce partner M&A activity

### Short-Term (Month 1-3)

- [ ] Identify 2-3 industry events for networking
- [ ] Begin building relationships with potential buyers
- [ ] Start "transaction readiness" checklist
- [ ] Prepare 1-page business overview (not a sales doc)

### Medium-Term (Month 3-6)

- [ ] Have informal conversations with 3-5 potential buyers

- [ ] Consider advisor engagement (if pursuing formal process)
- [ ] Continue services optimization (higher EBITDA = higher price)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **RS is just an idea** — Needs research before pursuit
2. **Cultivate multiple options** — Never negotiate with one buyer
3. **Time is your friend** — Don't signal urgency
4. **Transaction readiness** — Be ready even if not selling
5. **Strategic Leverage path** — Sell when product PMF is clear, not before

The goal is **optionality**: Know your options so you can make the best decision when timing is right.
