## Key Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Messaging Confusion (Path 2 Specific)

**Mitigation**: Clear phase-based messaging with team training. Each phase has distinct target audience and talking points. Monthly messaging reviews to ensure alignment.

### Risk 2: Competitor Response to Compliance Opportunity

**Mitigation**: First-mover advantage (Helm positioning as compliance leader by March). Build barriers: decision trace data library, customer reference base, analyst recognition.

### Risk 3: Product Not Ready for Scale (All Paths)

**Mitigation**: Product team validates compliance features (Path 1/2) or productivity features (Path 3) are production-ready by February 15. Load testing and performance verification before campaign launch.

### Risk 4: Sales Team Not Prepared

**Mitigation**: Intensive training by February 1. Role-playing compliance demos. Messaging drills. Sales playbook walkthroughs. Ongoing coaching through execution.

### Risk 5: August 2 Deadline Miss

**Mitigation**: Weekly progress tracking from June 1 onward. Escalation path for at-risk implementations. Professional services team on standby for critical customers.
