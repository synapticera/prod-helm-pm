# Strategic Path Analysis: Services + Product Business Decision Framework

**Date**: January 9, 2026
**Context**: Deep analysis of three strategic paths for a $4M Salesforce consulting business with a promising AI product (Helm)
**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive analysis to maximize returns over next 2-3 years

---

## Executive Summary

You're at a pivotal decision point with two distinct assets:

1. **Services business**: $4M Salesforce consulting, AI-focused, moderate IP
2. **Product business**: Helm—early-stage AI decision infrastructure play with exceptional market timing

The three paths you've outlined (Lean, Liquidate, Growth Both) each have merit, but **the optimal strategy depends on one critical question**: How much do you believe in Helm's market timing and your ability to execute on it?

**My recommendation**: A **modified hybrid approach** that I'll call **"Strategic Leverage"**—use services strategically to de-risk product development while maintaining optionality. This is neither full lean nor full liquidation, but something more nuanced.

## Market Context: Why This Decision Matters Now

### The AI Market Inflection (2026)

Based on your research and current market conditions:

| Factor                  | Data Point                         | Implication                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Agent adoption**      | 40% of enterprise apps by end 2026 | Massive deployment wave happening now                  |
| **Governance gap**      | 33% of AI deployments fail         | Management infrastructure is urgent need               |
| **Spending deferral**   | 25% of AI spend moving to 2027     | CFOs demanding ROI proof—creates urgency for solutions |
| **Regulatory pressure** | EU AI Act effective Aug 2, 2026    | Compliance infrastructure becomes mandatory            |
| **VC alignment**        | Foundation Capital's $4.6T thesis  | Decision infrastructure is the opportunity             |

**Critical insight**: The market window for establishing Helm as category leader is **12-24 months**. After that, incumbents will respond and competition intensifies.

### Services Business Market Reality

From [Salesforce Ben](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-ma-in-2025-top-10-factors-that-affect-valuations/) and [Aventis Advisors](https://aventis-advisors.com/it-services-valuation-multiples/):

| Metric                | Current Range                    | Notes                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Revenue multiples** | 2.5x-3.5x revenue                | For quality Salesforce partners        |
| **EBITDA multiples**  | 12x-14x EBITDA                   | IT Consulting trending at 13.6x        |
| **Deal activity**     | Increasing in 2025-2026          | M&A picking up in Salesforce ecosystem |
| **Buyer types**       | PE portcos (39%), Large IT (38%) | Multiple buyer categories active       |

**Your $4M services business** could reasonably command:

- **Revenue multiple**: $10M-14M (2.5x-3.5x)
- **EBITDA multiple**: Depends on margin—at 15% EBITDA ($600K), ~$8M; at 20% ($800K), ~$11M
- **Realistic exit range**: $8M-$14M depending on quality factors

## Deep Analysis: The Three Paths

### Path 1: LEAN (Services Cash Flow + Modest Product Investment)

**The Strategy**: Keep services lean and cash-flow positive while funding product modestly from operating profits.

#### Financial Model (Estimated)

| Year | Services Revenue | Services Profit | Product Investment | Net Cash Position |
| ---- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Y1   | $3.5M            | $400K           | ($300K)            | +$100K            |
| Y2   | $3.2M            | $350K           | ($350K)            | $0                |
| Y3   | $3.0M            | $300K           | ($300K)            | $0                |

**Assumptions**:

- Services shrinks slightly due to reduced investment
- ~12% profit margin on lean services
- Product consumes most of the cash generated

#### Pros

1. **Focus**: Single strategic direction, less context-switching
2. **Capital efficiency**: No dilution, no external capital needed
3. **Runway**: Self-funded path to product-market fit
4. **Optionality**: Can pivot if product doesn't work

#### Cons

1. **Speed disadvantage**: $300K/year in product investment vs. competitors raising $5-20M
2. **Team morale**: "Lean" often means key people leave for better opportunities
3. **Single point of failure**: If Helm doesn't work, you've also degraded services
4. **Market timing risk**: 12-24 month window requires faster execution than lean allows

#### Critical Questions to Answer

- Can you achieve product-market fit on $300K/year?
- Will your best services people stay in a "lean" environment?
- Can you compete against funded competitors at this investment level?

#### When This Path Makes Sense

- If you have low conviction in Helm's market opportunity
- If the market timing is actually 3-5 years, not 12-24 months
- If you have unique product advantages that require less capital

**My assessment**: This path **underestimates the urgency** of the market window. Helm's thesis is validated by MIT, McKinsey, Bain, Forrester, and Foundation Capital. The constraint is governance infrastructure, and the window is NOW. Going lean means you might perfect the product just as the window closes.

---

### Path 2: LIQUIDATE SERVICES (Sell for ~$5M, Fund Product Aggressively)

**The Strategy**: Sell the services business outright, use proceeds to fully capitalize product development.

#### Financial Model (Estimated)

| Item                   | Low Case  | Mid Case  | High Case  |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Sale price**         | $8M       | $10M      | $14M       |
| **Net after tax/fees** | $5.5M     | $7M       | $10M       |
| **Product runway**     | 24 months | 30 months | 36+ months |
| **Burn rate**          | $200K/mo  | $200K/mo  | $200K/mo   |

#### Pros

1. **Full focus**: 100% attention on product, no services distraction
2. **Capitalization**: Significant runway without equity dilution
3. **Speed**: Can hire aggressively, compete with funded startups
4. **Clean narrative**: Pure product company for future fundraising

#### Cons

1. **Transaction risk**: M&A is distracting and unpredictable—6-12 months of focus
2. **Cash timing**: Earnouts common; may not get cash upfront
3. **Single chip**: All-in on Helm; if it fails, no fallback
4. **Services integration value**: Lose the "lab" for testing product ideas

#### Critical Questions to Answer

- **Can you get cash upfront?** Earnouts are common; 50-60% upfront typical
- **Do you have a bluebird buyer?** (You mentioned "RS"—this matters enormously)
- **What's the realistic timeline?** Even hot deals take 6 months minimum
- **Can you retain key people through transition?**

#### Transaction Reality Check

From [Solganick M&A data](https://solganick.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Salesforce-Partner-Mergers-Update-Q3-and-YTD-2025.pdf):

**Typical Salesforce Partner Deal Structure**:

- 50-70% cash at close
- 30-50% earnout over 1-3 years
- Key person retention requirements (12-24 months)
- Non-compete clauses (2-3 years typically)

**If you're tied up in earnout and retention**:

- You can't fully focus on product
- You might need to stay with the buyer for 1-2 years
- Product development suffers during transition

#### When This Path Makes Sense

- If you have a buyer ready NOW with good terms (cash upfront)
- If the services business is becoming a distraction
- If you have extremely high conviction in Helm
- If you can close in 90 days, not 12 months

**My assessment**: This path is **theoretically optimal but practically risky**. The M&A process itself consumes 6-12 months of focus. If you get 60% cash and 2-year earnout, you're not actually "free" to focus on product. The path makes sense only if you have an exceptional buyer situation already lined up.

### Path 3: GROWTH BOTH (New Services Leader + VC for Product)

**The Strategy**: Hire leadership for services business, raise VC for product, grow both simultaneously.

#### Financial Model (Estimated)

| Element              | Services                             | Product            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Y1 investment**    | $200K (new leader + working capital) | $3M raise          |
| **Y1 revenue**       | $4.5M                                | $0-500K            |
| **Y2 revenue**       | $6M                                  | $2-5M              |
| **Y3 revenue**       | $8M                                  | $10-20M            |
| **Total value (Y3)** | $20-28M (at 3.5x)                    | $50-100M+ (at 10x) |

#### Pros

1. **Diversification**: Two shots at value creation
2. **Services as lab**: Test product ideas with real customers
3. **Cash flow support**: Services can subsidize product burn
4. **Optionality**: Can sell services later at higher value

#### Cons

1. **Focus dilution**: Two businesses = split attention
2. **Capital intensive**: Need both working capital (services) AND VC (product)
3. **Team complexity**: Different cultures, different incentives
4. **Execution risk**: Running two businesses is genuinely hard

#### Critical Questions to Answer

- Can you find a strong services leader who can operate independently?
- Will VCs invest in a product company with a services "distraction"?
- Do you have the bandwidth to manage both?
- Is there real synergy, or are they actually separate businesses?

#### VC Perspective on Hybrid Companies

From [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/26/whats-ahead-for-startups-and-vcs-in-2026-investors-weigh-in/) and [Carta](https://carta.com/data/saas-industry-spotlight-Q3-2025/):

**VC sentiment on services + product companies**:

- VCs generally **dislike** services revenue mixed with product
- Services margin (20-30%) vs. software margin (80%+) creates "blended" problem
- Some VCs see services as "dependency" or "distraction"
- **Exception**: If services clearly feeds product (like consulting that generates product insights)

**Valuation impact**:

- Pure product companies get 30-40x revenue multiples (AI premium)
- Hybrid companies get 10-15x at best
- Services revenue typically valued at 2-3x, dragging down blended valuation

#### When This Path Makes Sense

- If you have a strong operator ready to run services
- If services and product have genuine synergy (not just co-existence)
- If you want to maximize total enterprise value, not just product
- If you're willing to accept complexity for diversification

**My assessment**: This path **overcomplicates the situation** unless you have exceptional leadership bandwidth. VCs will likely push you to spin off or de-emphasize services anyway. The "synergy" between services and product is often overstated—they're actually different businesses with different customers, sales cycles, and economics.

---

## The Fourth Path: STRATEGIC LEVERAGE (My Recommendation)

**The Strategy**: Use services strategically as a **bridge**, not a permanent feature. Extract maximum value from services to fund product while maintaining optionality, then transition fully to product.

### How It Works

#### Phase 1: Strategic Extraction (Months 1-12)

1. **Optimize services for cash generation**
   - Keep services lean but not growth-oriented
   - Target 20%+ EBITDA margin
   - Extract $600K-$800K cash per year

2. **Use services as product lab**
   - Deploy Helm concepts with services clients
   - Generate case studies and product validation
   - Build reference customers for product sales

3. **Soft-market the services business**
   - Identify potential acquirers without formal process
   - Understand what deal terms you could get
   - Keep optionality open

4. **Fund initial product development**
   - Use services cash flow for MVP/early customers
   - Target 3-5 design partners from services relationships
   - Validate product-market fit before raising

#### Phase 2: Strategic Decision Point (Month 12-18)

Based on product traction, choose one of three sub-paths:

**2A: Product winning → Accelerate liquidation**

- Strong PMF signals = sell services quickly
- Use cash to fund aggressive product growth
- Raise seed/Series A with validation in hand

**2B: Product promising but slower → Maintain hybrid**

- Continue services cash flow extraction
- Raise smaller seed round for product
- Keep services as safety net

**2C: Product struggling → Pivot or double-down on services**

- If product thesis isn't validating, preserve services value
- Can still sell services for $8-14M
- Or pivot product direction with learnings

### Financial Model: Strategic Leverage

| Element                | Y1      | Y2                   | Y3            |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| **Services revenue**   | $4M     | $3.5M (sold at $10M) | —             |
| **Services cash flow** | $700K   | $400K + $7M net      | —             |
| **Product investment** | ($500K) | ($2M)                | ($3M)         |
| **Product revenue**    | $200K   | $2M                  | $10M          |
| **External capital**   | $0      | $3M seed             | $10M Series A |
| **Total value**        | $15M    | $35M                 | $100M+        |

### Why This Path Optimizes for Your Situation

1. **Preserves optionality**: You're not betting everything on one path
2. **Uses time wisely**: 12 months to validate product before major commitment
3. **Leverages assets**: Services cash flow and customer relationships fuel product
4. **De-risks for VCs**: By time you raise, you have validation, not just thesis
5. **Maintains focus**: You're doing one thing (building product) with services as fuel

## Critical Success Factors Across All Paths

### 1. Team Morale (You Mentioned This)

From [Startup Grind](https://www.startupgrind.com/blog/how-to-successfully-transition-from-consulting-to-products/):

**The services→product transition is brutal on teams**:

- Services people value client relationships and immediate impact
- Product people value scale and long-term vision
- Mixing them creates culture clash

**Recommendations**:

- Be explicit about the strategy and timeline
- Create clear paths for both types of people
- Don't pretend services is "strategic" if you plan to sell it
- Offer retention incentives tied to product milestones

### 2. Cash Generation from Services

**The #1 question**: How much cash can services actually generate?

| Scenario      | Revenue | EBITDA % | Cash Flow | Product Runway |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- | --------- | -------------- |
| **Optimized** | $4M     | 20%      | $800K     | Solid base     |
| **Current**   | $4M     | 12%      | $480K     | Tight          |
| **Declining** | $3M     | 10%      | $300K     | Insufficient   |

**If services can't generate $600K+ cash flow**, the lean path doesn't work and you need external capital regardless.

### 3. Product Validation Timeline

From your research synthesis, Helm's thesis is validated by:

- MIT CISR: 34% of enterprises stuck in pilot phase (your market)
- McKinsey: 61% not seeing EBIT impact despite AI deployment (the pain)
- Bain: Governance must be foundational (your product)
- Foundation Capital: Decision infrastructure is $1T+ opportunity (your TAM)

**The validation question**: Can you get 3-5 paying customers in 12 months?

- If yes → Path 2 (Liquidate) or Strategic Leverage Phase 2A
- If unclear → Strategic Leverage Phase 2B
- If no → Need to reconsider thesis

### 4. Bluebird Buyer (You Mentioned "RS")

**This could change everything**. If you have a specific buyer interested:

| Scenario                              | Impact on Strategy                      |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **RS wants to buy NOW at fair price** | Accelerate liquidation; take the deal   |
| **RS is interested but not urgent**   | Use as leverage in soft-market process  |
| **RS wants services AND product**     | Potentially keep both under RS umbrella |
| **RS is just exploratory**            | Don't factor into strategy              |

**Question to answer**: What's the actual status with RS?

## Market Evolution Analysis: 2026-2028

### Why Timing Matters So Much

From [Foundation Capital](https://foundationcapital.com/where-ai-is-headed-in-2026/) and [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/vcs-predict-enterprises-will-spend-more-on-ai-in-2026-through-fewer-vendors/):

**2026: The Consolidation Year**

- Enterprises spending more on AI but through **fewer vendors**
- Winners getting picked; losers getting cut
- "AI veneer" companies failing; "AI substance" companies winning

**2027: The Shakeout**

- First wave of AI governance winners established
- Salesforce/ServiceNow likely have competing offerings
- Market share crystallizes

**2028: The New Normal**

- Decision infrastructure is table stakes
- Network effects favor early leaders
- Late entrants struggle to compete

**Implication**: You have 18-24 months to establish Helm as a leader. The "lean" path likely takes too long. The "growth both" path dilutes focus. The "liquidate" or "strategic leverage" paths give you the best shot at the right timing.

### Competitive Landscape Evolution

| Competitor     | Current Status             | 2-Year Trajectory                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Salesforce** | Building Agentforce        | Will have basic governance; won't have decision context |
| **ServiceNow** | Deploying agents           | Will have monitoring; won't have Mine/Design capability |
| **Celonis**    | Process mining focus       | May pivot to governance; enterprise-only                |
| **Startups**   | Various approaches         | Most underfunded or unfocused                           |
| **Helm**       | Early but validated thesis | **Need to execute fast**                                |

**Your competitive advantage**: You have the thesis, the research, and early market position. What you need is **capital and focus** to execute before the window closes.

## Risk Analysis by Path

### Path 1 (Lean) Risk Matrix

| Risk                 | Likelihood  | Impact   | Mitigation                    |
| -------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Product underfunded  | High        | Critical | None without external capital |
| Team attrition       | High        | High     | Retention packages            |
| Market timing miss   | Medium-High | Critical | None—structural risk          |
| Services degradation | Medium      | Medium   | Maintain key accounts         |

**Overall risk**: HIGH. Single point of failure with insufficient resources.

### Path 2 (Liquidate) Risk Matrix

| Risk              | Likelihood | Impact   | Mitigation                 |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| Transaction delay | High       | High     | Multiple buyer cultivation |
| Earnout trap      | Medium     | High     | Negotiate for cash upfront |
| Product fails     | Medium     | Critical | None—all-in bet            |
| Team transition   | Medium     | Medium   | Clear communication        |

**Overall risk**: MEDIUM-HIGH. High reward if executed well; catastrophic if product fails.

### Path 3 (Growth Both) Risk Matrix

| Risk                 | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                   |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Focus dilution       | Very High  | High   | Strong services leader       |
| VC disinterest       | High       | High   | Separate entities cleanly    |
| Capital inefficiency | High       | Medium | Clear capital allocation     |
| Team confusion       | Medium     | Medium | Distinct cultures/incentives |

**Overall risk**: HIGH. Complexity creates many failure modes.

### Path 4 (Strategic Leverage) Risk Matrix

| Risk                       | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Services cash insufficient | Medium     | High   | Early VC outreach                    |
| Product validation slow    | Medium     | Medium | Clear decision criteria at 12 months |
| Buyer market changes       | Low        | Medium | Stay market-ready                    |
| Team uncertainty           | Medium     | Medium | Clear timeline communication         |

**Overall risk**: MEDIUM. Maintains optionality while making progress.

## Financial Scenarios: 3-Year Value Creation

### Scenario 1: Helm Succeeds (60% probability if well-funded)

| Path                   | Year 3 Value            | Your Equity Value        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Lean**               | $30M (late to market)   | $25M (83%)               |
| **Liquidate**          | $100M (market leader)   | $50M (50% post-dilution) |
| **Growth Both**        | $80M (both businesses)  | $45M (55%)               |
| **Strategic Leverage** | $90M (well-timed entry) | $55M (60%)               |

### Scenario 2: Helm Struggles (25% probability)

| Path                   | Year 3 Value                             | Your Equity Value |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Lean**               | $5M (degraded services + failed product) | $4M               |
| **Liquidate**          | $0 (ran out of money)                    | $0                |
| **Growth Both**        | $15M (services saved you)                | $10M              |
| **Strategic Leverage** | $12M (sold services in time)             | $10M              |

### Scenario 3: Helm Pivots/Different Opportunity (15% probability)

| Path                   | Year 3 Value                 | Your Equity Value |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Lean**               | $15M (preserved services)    | $12M              |
| **Liquidate**          | $5M (some runway left)       | $3M               |
| **Growth Both**        | $25M (both assets available) | $18M              |
| **Strategic Leverage** | $20M (optionality paid off)  | $15M              |

### Expected Value Calculation

| Path                   | E(V) = Σ(Probability × Value)                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Lean**               | 0.6($25M) + 0.25($4M) + 0.15($12M) = **$17.8M**  |
| **Liquidate**          | 0.6($50M) + 0.25($0) + 0.15($3M) = **$30.5M**    |
| **Growth Both**        | 0.6($45M) + 0.25($10M) + 0.15($18M) = **$32.2M** |
| **Strategic Leverage** | 0.6($55M) + 0.25($10M) + 0.15($15M) = **$37.8M** |

**Note**: These are illustrative. Your actual probabilities and values may differ significantly.

## My Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: Strategic Leverage Path

**Why**: It optimizes for:

1. **Market timing**: Gets you moving fast on product
2. **Risk management**: Preserves optionality if product struggles
3. **Capital efficiency**: Uses services cash before raising
4. **VC positioning**: Validates thesis before fundraising
5. **Team alignment**: Clear direction with timeline

### Implementation Roadmap

#### Months 1-3: Foundation

- [ ] Optimize services for cash extraction (target 20% EBITDA)
- [ ] Identify 3-5 services clients as potential Helm design partners
- [ ] Soft-market services business to understand deal terms
- [ ] Begin product MVP development with services cash

#### Months 4-6: Validation

- [ ] Deploy Helm concepts with 2-3 design partners
- [ ] Document case studies and outcomes
- [ ] Continue services cash extraction
- [ ] Build investor relationship pipeline

#### Months 7-12: Decision Point

- [ ] Assess product-market fit signals
- [ ] If strong: Accelerate services sale + raise seed
- [ ] If moderate: Continue hybrid + smaller raise
- [ ] If weak: Preserve services value + pivot product

#### Months 13-24: Execution

- [ ] Based on Month 12 decision, execute chosen path
- [ ] Focus resources on highest-conviction opportunity
- [ ] Scale product if validated, or optimize exit otherwise

### Contingency Recommendations

**If RS buyer is ready NOW**:

- Prioritize the conversation
- If terms are good (70%+ cash, minimal earnout), take the deal
- Use capital to go all-in on Helm

**If services cash flow is <$500K**:

- Path 1 (Lean) is not viable
- Need external capital regardless
- Consider raising seed now with services as "validation lab" narrative

**If product validation is slower than expected**:

- Don't panic—adjust timeline
- Services provides runway while you iterate
- Stay ready to sell services if product thesis invalidates

## Questions to Decide Now

Before finalizing strategy, clarify:

1. **Services cash flow**: What's the realistic EBITDA margin? Can you get to 20%?

2. **RS situation**: Is there a real buyer interested? What terms are possible?

3. **Product conviction**: On a 1-10 scale, how confident are you in Helm's market opportunity? (If <7, lean toward conservative paths)

4. **Founder bandwidth**: Can you realistically manage both businesses for 12 months? Do you have operating help?

5. **Team situation**: Who are the key people in services? Will they stay in a "bridge" scenario?

6. **Fundraising readiness**: If you needed to raise seed in 6 months, could you? What's missing?

## Conclusion

The three paths you've outlined are all viable, but each has significant tradeoffs. The "Strategic Leverage" path I'm recommending is a **modified hybrid** that:

- **Uses services as fuel**, not a permanent feature
- **Maintains optionality** while making progress
- **Aligns with market timing** (18-24 month window)
- **Positions you for optimal fundraising** (validation before raising)
- **Manages risk** without sacrificing upside

The key insight from your market research is clear: **Helm's thesis is validated by the best minds in the industry**. The opportunity is real. The question is execution timing and resource allocation.

My recommendation: **Don't go lean** (too slow for the market window), **don't rush to liquidate** (unless you have exceptional buyer terms), and **don't try to grow both** (too complex). Instead, **use services strategically as a bridge to a product-focused future**.

The next 12 months will tell you which definitive path to take. Use that time wisely.
