- **TAM:** $50B+

## Three Strategic Options

### Option 1: Pure Current (DI for CS)
**Pros:** Fast GTM, proven freemium mechanics, clear Series A path
**Cons:** Smaller TAM, passes on $50B opportunity
**Best if:** Focused on quick Series A, confident in CS market

### Option 2: Pure Dan (Work Elevation)
**Pros:** Massive TAM, clear enterprise positioning, traction already exists
**Cons:** Longer sales cycles, requires enterprise expertise, further from Series A
**Best if:** Have enterprise sales, willing to take longer path to $100M+

### Option 3: Hybrid (Work Elevation for Customer Service)
**Pros:** Maintains $50B TAM upside, fast GTM via CS, horizontal extensibility, Series A velocity
**Cons:** More complex positioning, requires disciplined roadmap, investors may want pure play
**Best if:** Want both markets, believe CS is legitimate beachhead

## Key Decision Questions

**Question 1: TAM Preference?**
- $50B horizontal (Dan) vs. $2-3B vertical (Current)?

**Question 2: GTM Comfort?**
- Enterprise sales (Dan) vs. Freemium/PLG (Current)?

**Question 3: Competitive Moat?**
- Observation data (Dan) vs. Decision data (Current)?

**Question 4: Time Horizon?**
- 12-18 months to Series A (Current) vs. 18-24 months (Dan)?

**Question 5: Product Scope?**
- Broad automation (Dan) vs. Focused CS (Current)?

## Recommendation: Hybrid

**Positioning:** "Work Elevation Platform for Customer Service"

**Why:**
1. ✅ Maintains $50B TAM while starting with proven $2-3B market
2. ✅ CS freemium provides fast land-and-expand (Series A velocity)
3. ✅ Observation + Decision governance = two-part defensibility moat
4. ✅ Horizontal extensibility built into product roadmap
5. ✅ First-mover in "DI for CS" category while building broader platform

**Series A Narrative:** "Proved observation→governance model in customer service; now expanding to all enterprise automation workflows"

## What This Means for preso-outline.md

### Narrative Changes Needed:
1. **Slide 2d (NEW):** Add "The Missing Layer" — positioning as both observation + governance layer
2. **Slide 3:** Reframe solution as 3-phase journey (Observe → Augment → Automate) within CS context
3. **Slide 4:** Strengthen competitive positioning with "observation" layer advantage
4. **Slide 5:** Maintain financial projections (current CS path)
5. **Appendix:** Add "Horizontal Expansion Roadmap" showing growth beyond CS

### Key Language Updates:
- **From:** "Decision Intelligence Platform for Customer Service"
- **To:** "Work Elevation Platform for Customer Service" (or similar hybrid framing)
- **Add:** Dan's core insight: "You can't automate what you don't understand"
- **Add:** Stack positioning: observation layer between HITL and orchestration
