## Key Concepts Index

### The Executive Function Lifecycle
**Definition**: Five-stage framework for successful agent deployment
1. **UNDERSTAND** (Mine): What decisions are we making today?
2. **PLAN** (Design): What should agents decide vs. what stays human?
3. **SELL** (Design transparency): Who's bought in? Who has concerns?
4. **EXECUTE** (Manage): Are agents following the plan? Is every decision auditable?
5. **MONITOR & CORRECT** (Monitor): Are agents delivering intended outcomes?

**Why It Matters**: 95% of AI projects fail because companies skip stages 1-3 and jump to execution. Companies executing the full lifecycle see 5-7x better outcomes.

**Materials**: [Lifecycle One-Pager](helm-lifecycle-one-pager.html) | [Messaging Guide](helm-messaging-guide.md) | [Product Positioning](helm-product-positioning.md)

---

### Decision Intelligence
**Definition**: Infrastructure that captures "why" decisions are made, not just that they were made
- Decision Traces: Complete records with context and lineage
- Context Graphs: Structured data showing what matters
- Decision Policies: Explicit specifications agents follow
- Precedent Libraries: Learning systems that improve over time

**Why It Matters**: Compliance audits, continuous improvement, defensible moat from decision data.

**Materials**: [Product Positioning - Decision Intelligence Section](helm-product-positioning.md#what-is-decision-intelligence) | [Positioning Document - Category Section](helm-positioning.md#the-emerging-category)

---

### Constraint-Hunting Principle
**Definition**: Attack the NEXT constraint before it becomes bottleneck, not the current one

**Pattern**:
- Current constraint gets solved → becomes commoditized
- Winners attack next constraint → defensible positioning
- Example: Email (current = send messages, commoditized; next = organize/search, Gmail won)

**Why It Matters**: Explains why Helm wins (we're solving management, not agents).

**Materials**: [Messaging Guide - Constraint Hunting](helm-messaging-guide.md#the-constraint-hunting-principle) | [Positioning Document](helm-positioning.md#the-strategic-principle-attack-the-next-constraint-not-the-current-one)

---

### $1 Trillion Productivity Opportunity
**Definition**: Market size for productivity gains across all enterprise functions (CS, Finance, Operations, HR)

**Entry Point**: "To drive productivity, you must understand how work is done today."

**Flow**: Understand Today → Envision Tomorrow → Execute Transition = Productivity Gains

**Why It Matters**: Market entry point for service leaders. Massive TAM.

**Materials**: [Messaging Guide - $1T Frame](helm-messaging-guide.md#the-1-trillion-opportunity-frame) | [Positioning Document - Productivity Section](helm-positioning.md#the-1-trillion-productivity-opportunity-the-entry-point)

---

## One-Line Reminders

**Positioning**: "Decision Intelligence Platform for Customer Service"
**Core Insight**: "Management is the constraint, not capability"
**Market Entry**: "$1T productivity opportunity + executive function lifecycle"
**Why Helm Wins**: "We solve the NEXT constraint (management); competitors solve current (agents)"
**Outcome**: "5-7x better productivity gains vs. 10-20% from ad-hoc"
**Moat**: "Decision trace data creates defensible network effects"
**Category**: "DI = infrastructure for HOW agents should decide"
**Regulatory**: "Full decision audit trail = native compliance"

---

## Frequently Used Soundbites

**For Any Audience (30 seconds)**:
> "95% of AI projects fail because teams skip understanding current decisions, planning how agents should operate, and getting buy-in. Helm provides that infrastructure—the executive function layer that separates winners from those wasting 90% of their opportunity. Companies executing the full lifecycle see 5-7x better outcomes."

**For Service Leaders**:
> "Most AI deployments fail because teams skip understanding how work is done today. We provide the infrastructure to understand your current operations, plan the transition with agents, get your team bought in, execute with control, and prove the results. That's how you capture 5-7x better productivity gains."

**For Investors**:
> "95% of AI projects fail due to incomplete management infrastructure. We're building that infrastructure—the executive function layer for successful agent deployment. Defensible moat from decision traces. $1T market opportunity. First-mover in Decision Intelligence category for customer service."

**For Analysts**:
> "Decision Intelligence is emerging as mandatory infrastructure for AI maturity. Helm is first-mover claiming this category for customer service—the largest AI deployment use case. Similar to how databases became mandatory for data-driven software."
