## 🎓 Key Narratives to Master

### 1. "We Called It First"
- **Timeline:** Thesis 6 months ago → Ed Sim/Gartner/Forrester validating now
- **Implication:** We're early to crystallizing category, not late to trend
- **Investor Hook:** FOMO + category ownership + first-mover advantage

### 2. "Market is Crystallizing NOW"
- **Evidence:** Gartner (DI #1 trend), Forrester (Agent Control Planes), VCs (Execution Intelligence)
- **Inflection:** 40% of enterprise apps getting agents by 2026 (Gartner)
- **Problem:** 33% of deployments failing due to lack of decision infrastructure
- **Opportunity:** Regulatory pressure (EU AI Act) + governance gap + market confusion

### 3. "Why We're Not Repeating Vibes Coding Miss"
- **Issue #1:** Wrong tech stack (SFI platform-dependent → AI-native independent)
- **Issue #2:** Wrong team (past-focused → future-focused)
- **Issue #3:** Lack of conviction (incremental → all-in, bold positioning)
- **Issue #4:** Lean startup vs blitz (learning → execution at wave speed)

### 4. "Unique Market Position"
- **Only player:** High decision intelligence + low enterprise CAC
- **Legacy vendors:** Trapped at $100K+ deals, can't do SMB
- **Incumbents:** Too broad, no decision focus, service not core
- **Helm advantage:** Freemium model + vertical focus + speed
