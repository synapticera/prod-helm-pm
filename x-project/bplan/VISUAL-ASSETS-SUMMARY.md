### 3. **Competitive Positioning Matrix** 🎯
**File:** `helm-competitive-positioning.html` (Interactive positioning)

**Visual Elements:**
- **2D Matrix:** Decision Intelligence Depth (X-axis) vs Enterprise Maturity/CAC (Y-axis)
- **Competitor Positions:**
  - Helm: High DI + Low CAC (🌟 Unique sweet spot)
  - Celonis: High DI + High CAC (trapped in enterprise)
  - UiPath: Medium DI + High CAC (process-focused)
  - Salesforce: Low DI + High maturity (too broad)
  - Microsoft: Low DI + High maturity (too broad)

**Detailed Comparison Table (10 dimensions):**
| Capability | Helm | Celonis | UiPath | Salesforce | Microsoft |
|-----------|------|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Decision Mining | ✓ Native | Partial | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Executive Interface | ✓ Yes | Technical | Technical | Partial | Partial |
| Freemium Model | ✓ Yes | Enterprise | Enterprise | Limited | Limited |
| SMB Addressable | ✓ 150K+ | 8K | 8K | Broad | Broad |
| Time-to-Value | ✓ Days | Months | Months | Weeks | Weeks |
| AI Agent Governance | ✓ Native | Via RPA | Via Bots | Emerging | Emerging |
| Customer Service Focus | ✓ Vertical | Process | RPA | General | General |
| NDR | ✓ 110–180% | 80–110% | 85–120% | 120–150% | 130–160% |
| Compliance Built-In | ✓ Yes | Add-On | Add-On | Add-On | Add-On |
| First-Mover Category | ✓ Yes (DI for CS) | No | No | No | No |

**Why Competitors Can't Match:**
- Legacy vendors locked in enterprise model (high CAC, no SMB viability)
- Incumbents too broad (no specialization, not customer service focused)
- Process mining tools lack decision focus and vertical depth

**Helm's Defensibility:**
1. Network Effects (decision data fleet learning)
2. Category Ownership (first to claim DI for CS)
3. Vertical Specialization (deep CS expertise)
4. Regulatory Tailwind (EU AI Act compliance)
5. PLG Switching Costs (millions of free users)

- Slide 4a-4b (Why Helm Wins / Differentiation)
- Investor concerns about competition
- Appendix deep-dive on competitive analysis
