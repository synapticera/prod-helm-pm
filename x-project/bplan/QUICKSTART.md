## 💬 Key Narratives to Master

### "We Called It First"
- **What:** Identified Decision Intelligence need 6 months ago
- **Validation:** Ed Sim (Issue #479), Gartner (#1 trend), Forrester (Agent Control Planes)
- **Implication:** Not late to trend, early to crystallizing category
- **Investor Hook:** FOMO + first-mover advantage

### "Market is Crystallizing NOW"
- **Evidence:** 40% agent adoption (Gartner), 33% failure rate, EU AI Act enforcement
- **Window:** Limited time before incumbents catch on
- **Play:** Own the category narrative before competitors arrive

### "We're Not Repeating Vibes Coding Miss"
- **Issue #1:** Wrong tech stack (Salesforce → AI-native)
- **Issue #2:** Wrong team (past-focused → future-focused)
- **Issue #3:** Lack of conviction (incremental → all-in)
- **Issue #4:** Lean startup vs blitz (learning → execution speed)
- **Lesson:** We learned hard lessons; now executing differently

### "Unique Competitive Position"
- **Sweet Spot:** High DI + Low CAC (only us here)
- **Legacy Vendors:** High DI but $100K+ CAC (can't do SMB)
- **Incumbents:** Too broad, low DI, service not core
- **Helm:** Freemium + vertical + network effects
