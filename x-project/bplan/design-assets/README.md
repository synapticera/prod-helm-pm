### 3. **Competitive Positioning Matrix**
**File:** `helm-competitive-positioning.html`
**Purpose:** Two-dimensional positioning matrix showing Helm vs competitors in market space
**Market Dimensions:**
- **X-Axis:** Decision Intelligence Depth (Low → High)
- **Y-Axis:** Enterprise Maturity & CAC (High → Low)

**Competitor Positions:**
- **Helm** (Cyan): High Decision Intelligence + Low Enterprise CAC ⭐ Unique Position
- **Celonis** (Gray): High Decision Intelligence + High Enterprise CAC
- **UiPath** (Gray): Medium Decision Intelligence + High Enterprise CAC
- **Salesforce** (Orange): Low Decision Intelligence + High Enterprise Maturity
- **Microsoft** (Orange): Low Decision Intelligence + High Enterprise Maturity

**Detailed Feature Comparison Table:**
- Decision Mining: ✓ (Helm native), ✗ (others)
- Executive-Friendly Interface: ✓ (Helm), Technical (competitors)
- Freemium Model: ✓ (Helm), Enterprise Only (legacy vendors)
- SMB Addressable: ✓ (Helm 150K+), Limited (legacy)
- Time-to-Value: ✓ (Helm days), Months (competitors)
- AI Agent Governance: ✓ (Helm native)
- Customer Service Focus: ✓ (Helm vertical), Generic (competitors)
- Net Dollar Retention: ✓ (Helm 110–180%)
