## Executive Summary

The 2026 AI market is experiencing a fundamental inflection: companies are moving from **"Can we build AI agents?"** to **"How do we manage AI agents safely, effectively, and compliantly?"**

This inflection reveals an emerging **infrastructure category** that multiple industry voices are identifying using different terminology but describing the same concept:

| **Term** | **Who Uses It** | **Focus** |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Context Graphs** | Foundation Capital (VCs) | Structured organizational memory for agents |
| **Execution Intelligence Layer** | Ed Sim / Boldstart (VCs) | Specs + execution path recording |
| **Agent Control Plane** | Forrester (Analysts) | Governance and audit over autonomous systems |
| **Decision Intelligence** | Gartner (Analysts) | Engineering how decisions are made |

**The Category Thesis**: Traditional enterprise systems (Salesforce, SAP, Workday) store **WHAT happened** (state). The emerging category stores **WHY it happened** (decision traces, context, exceptions, approvals). Agents cannot operate safely without this "why" layer.

### Helm's Strategic Positioning

**Helm is positioned to own "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service"** — a vertical instantiation of this emerging infrastructure category. This positioning is validated by:

1. **Market Inflection** (2026):
   - 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by end of 2026
   - ~33% of service AI deployments will fail due to lack of decision infrastructure
   - 60% of Fortune 100 will appoint Chief AI Officer (creating governance demand)
   - Regulatory pressure: EU AI Act effective August 2, 2026 (demanding transparency & audit)

2. **Category Alignment**:
   - Gartner, Forrester, and Foundation Capital all converge on need for decision infrastructure
   - Helm's Mine/Design/Manage naturally captures decision traces and governance
   - First-mover advantage in claiming "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service"

3. **Vertical Specialization Win** (Ed Sim's Research):
   - Vertical specialists beat horizontal infrastructure plays
   - Customer service is largest AI deployment use case
   - Domain expertise + decision data = defensible network effects moat

4. **Product/Market Fit**:
   - Mine: Capture decisions from customer service interactions
   - Design: Model and governance decision policies
   - Manage: Govern and optimize agent decision-making
   - Result: Decision traces become precedent library that improves recommendations over time

### The Positioning Decision

After analyzing three positioning candidates:
- **Helm (Current)**: "AI-native executive command center..." (strong brand, weak category signal)
- **EA2**: "Executive Agent / Assistant 2.0" (creative, but infrastructure-agnostic)
- **Decision Intelligence for CS**: "Decision Intelligence Platform for Customer Service" (strongest on all dimensions)

**Winner**: **"Helm: Decision Intelligence Platform for Customer Service"**

This positioning:
- ✅ Claims emerging analyst category (Gartner, Forrester alignment)
- ✅ Emphasizes vertical specialization (Ed Sim's winning strategy)
- ✅ Signals infrastructure (defensible, not just a tool)
- ✅ Resonates with investors (VCs recognize "Decision Intelligence" language)
- ✅ Translates to customers (clear value narrative)
- ✅ Enables network effects story (decision traces as moat)
- ✅ Aligns with compliance needs (governance + audit = regulatory asset)

---

## The Emerging Category

### What Companies Are Calling It

The emerging category sits between human intent and software execution. It captures **"Decision Traces"**—living records of inputs, logic, exceptions, approvals, and outcomes. Multiple industry voices describe this same concept:

**VC Terminology** (Innovation Angle):
- **Ed Sim (Boldstart)**: "Execution Intelligence Layer"
  - Thesis: Agents need "specs" (boundaries/rules) + execution path recording
  - Value: Separates the "specification of intent" from "reliable execution"

- **Foundation Capital**: "Context Graphs"
  - Thesis: 2026 is "$Trillion Dollar Opportunity" to store organizational context
  - Key Insight: "Systems of Decision" will replace "Systems of Record" as central to enterprise
  - Value: Graph connects people, policies, history, and decisions—making "why" searchable

**Analyst Terminology** (Governance Angle):
- **Forrester**: "Agent Control Plane"
  - Positioning: 3-plane architecture—Build Plane (agents) → Orchestration Plane (work) → Control Plane (governance)
  - Key Focus: You cannot trust agents to police themselves; need external governance layer

- **Gartner**: "Decision Intelligence"
  - Definition: The engineering discipline of how decisions are made
  - Approach: "Composite AI" combining LLMs (probabilistic) with knowledge graphs + rules (symbolic) for safety

### The Core Problem Being Solved

Traditional enterprise systems are **state machines**: they record what happened.

```
Example: Ticket #123 is closed. Invoice #456 was paid.
Missing: Why was it closed without resolution? Why was invoice paid despite budget overrun?
```

AI agents need **context machines**: they need access to the reasoning behind decisions.

```
Complete Picture: Ticket closed because customer stopped responding. Invoice paid because VP authorized exception via Slack message + cost-benefit analysis.
This is what agents need to replicate human judgment.
```

### Why This Category Is Emerging in 2026

1. **Agent Maturity**: Agents are moving from demos to production (MCP adoption, Prediction #19)
2. **Governance Urgency**: 60% of Fortune 100 appointing Chief AI Officer; they need tools
3. **Regulatory Reality**: EU AI Act requires "meaningful human review" and transparency (Prediction #41)
4. **Moat Shift**: Companies realize competitive advantage isn't in the model, it's in the decision data
5. **Ecosystem Convergence**: VCs, analysts, and tech leaders all converging on same problem

## Why Decision Intelligence for Customer Service Wins

### 1. Analyst Category Alignment

Gartner has established **"Decision Intelligence"** as formal category in 2025 Hype Cycle for AI:

> "Decision Intelligence is the engineering discipline of how decisions are made. It bridges the gap between **Data** (insight) and **Agents** (action) by formalizing the logic, rules, and context required for reliable autonomy."

Forrester has defined **"Agent Control Plane"** as the governance layer that sits above agents:

> "The Control Plane enforces policies, audits decisions, records decision traces, and provides the 'why' that enables safe autonomy."

**Helm's Win**: Being the first to claim "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service" enables:
- Analyst briefings ("this is a new vendor category")
- Research coverage ("Decision Intelligence market growth")
- Gartner Magic Quadrant inclusion (if such quadrant emerges)
- Thought leadership positioning

### 2. Vertical Specialization Advantage

Ed Sim's research (#479) proves: **Vertical specialists win; horizontal infrastructure plays lose**

Key insight:
> "Building middleware layers proves incredibly hard. Incumbent SaaS providers will dominate by integrating agent capabilities. Large LLM companies will dominate by bundling orchestration. **Implication: Pure-play infrastructure plays face headwinds unless they're deeply specialized.**"

**Helm's Win**:
- Specializing in "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service" means:
  - Deep domain expertise in service decisions (routing, escalation, precedent, cost-quality tradeoffs)
  - Turnkey integrations with service platforms (Salesforce, Zendesk, etc.)
  - Defensible moat from service decision data
- Generic "Decision Intelligence Platform" would lose to horizontal incumbents

### 3. Regulatory Tailwind

EU AI Act (August 2, 2026 effective date) requires:
- "Meaningful human review" for high-risk AI
- Transparent decision lineage and audit trails
- Risk impact assessments

**Helm's Win**: Decision traces + governance = native compliance infrastructure
- Every decision captured and auditable
- Human review points enforced
- Regulatory liability reduced

This becomes a **compliance asset**, not an afterthought.

### 4. Product/Market Fit

Helm's architecture (Mine/Design/Manage) naturally maps to Decision Intelligence:

| Helm Module | Maps To | Creates |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Mine** | Decision Trace Capture | Records of how decisions were made (inputs, logic, exceptions) |
| **Design** | Decision Policy Modeling | Formal specifications of decision rules and governance |
| **Manage** | Decision Governance & Audit | Enforcement, monitoring, and audit of agent decisions |
| **Output** | Decision Precedent Library | Searchable library of decision examples for agents to learn from |

**Result**: Mine/Design/Manage isn't just a product; it's a complete Decision Intelligence workflow. Competitors would need to build similar architecture to compete.

### 5. Network Effects & Moat

Foundation Capital's insight: **Decision trace data becomes competitive advantage**

```
More Customers → More Decision Examples →
Better Precedent Library → Better Recommendations →
Stronger Competitive Advantage → More Customers
```

**Helm's Win**:
- Each customer's decision traces improve Helm's ability to make recommendations
- Over time, accumulated decision data becomes proprietary advantage
- Competitors starting today would take years to catch up
- Classic network effects moat (harder to copy than agents themselves)

### 6. Investor Messaging Clarity

Compare these pitches to VCs:

**Current ("Command Center" positioning)**:
"Helm is an executive command center that gives service leaders insights to optimize operations."
- ❓ What does this mean for AI agents?
- ❓ How is this different from Salesforce dashboards?
- ❓ What's the defensibility?

**Decision Intelligence positioning**:
"Helm captures organizational decision traces—the 'why' behind how service decisions are made. This enables safe agent autonomy while creating defensible network effects moat. As 40% of enterprise apps get AI agents in 2026, Helm provides the infrastructure layer that makes them work."
- ✅ Clear value prop for agent economy
- ✅ Infrastructure positioning (defensible)
- ✅ Network effects story
- ✅ Category alignment (VCs recognize DI language)

## Market Predictions Supporting Helm

### Prediction #1: AI Agents Will Explode, But Governance Is Uncertain

**Gartner**: 40% of enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents by end of 2026
**Gartner**: 60% of Fortune 100 will appoint head of AI governance in 2026

**What This Means for Helm**:
- Massive TAM expansion (agents in 40% of apps = billions in annual deals)
- Critical need for agent governance and context (exactly what Helm provides)
- Agent control planes will become real infrastructure (Mine/Design/Manage = control plane)

**Helm's Narrative**:
> "While 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by 2026, the real question isn't whether agents exist—it's whether they operate with intelligence and governance. Helm is the decision intelligence layer that enables safe, contextualized agent autonomy."

---

### Prediction #2: Service Quality Will Dip; Companies Will Rush

**CustomerThink**: ~33% of brands rolling out AI in self-service will fail
**Prediction**: 30% of enterprises will create parallel "AI functions" mirroring human roles

**What This Means for Helm**:
- Companies deploying service AI without decision context will fail
- Those that fail will be looking for solutions to get back on track (huge market opportunity)
- "AI function" creation = explicit admission that managing AI is different from managing humans

**Helm's Narrative**:
> "Most AI service deployments will fail in 2026 because companies mistake 'deploying an agent' for 'managing decisions.' Helm bridges this gap by capturing decision traces—what decisions matter, who makes them, what context is required."

**GTM Implication**: Not just greenfield opportunity, but recovery/remediation market.

---

### Prediction #3: Domain-Specific Models Will Dominate

**Gartner**: By 2028, over 50% of GenAI models used by enterprises will be domain-specific
**Stanford HAI**: Shift from "AI evangelism" to "AI evaluation"—focus on measured productivity gains

**What This Means for Helm**:
- Generic "customer service AI" won't win; domain-specific decision intelligence will
- Helm's customer service specialization aligns with this trend
- This validates Ed Sim's vertical specialization thesis

**Helm's Narrative**:
> "The AI market is bifurcating. Generic models are table stakes. Winners specialize. Helm is decision intelligence **for** customer service—not a generic agent platform. We understand service decisions deeply: routing, escalation, precedent, cost-quality tradeoffs."

---

### Prediction #4: Agentic Workflows Are Becoming Production-Ready

**Axios**: With MCP reducing friction, agentic workflows will move from demos into day-to-day business

**What This Means for Helm**:
- The infrastructure question shifts from "can agents work?" to "how do we manage agent decisions in production?"
- Agents need context to make good decisions; Helm provides that context

**Helm's Narrative**:
> "Agentic workflows are finally production-ready in 2026. But production readiness requires decision intelligence. Helm sits between your customer service agents (human and AI) and your systems, capturing decision context: precedents, policies, outcomes, exceptions."

---

### Prediction #5: New AI Roles Are Emerging

**Solutions Review**: New roles will emerge: AI workflow designers, automation auditors, **AI agent managers/coaches**
**Insight**: Strategic judgment + AI power is most sought-after talent

**What This Means for Helm**:
- Organizations will hire "AI agent managers" whose job is managing AI decisions
- These people need tools to understand agent behavior, debug decisions, set policies

**Helm's Narrative**:
> "30% of enterprises will create parallel 'AI functions' in 2026. Who manages those functions? The AI Agent Manager—a new role that didn't exist in 2024. Helm is built for them. It's their command center for understanding why agents make decisions, setting policies, debugging failures."

---

### Prediction #6: Transparency & Trust Are Non-Negotiable

**Solutions Review**: AI systems without transparent lineage and measurable trust signals will be too risky to deploy
**PwC**: Enterprise AI Strategy Centralization with top-down governance

**What This Means for Helm**:
- Risk aversion will drive demand for "explainable AI" infrastructure
- Helm's decision traces and context graphs directly address this need

**Helm's Narrative**:
> "Transparency isn't nice-to-have in 2026—it's mandatory. Helm captures the full decision lineage: inputs, logic, exceptions, outcomes. You don't just deploy agents; you audit them. You don't just trust recommendations; you understand why they were made."

---

### Prediction #7: Regulations Are Tightening

**Morrison Foerster**: EU AI Act fully applicable August 2, 2026 (risk-based obligations)
**US Trend**: State-level AI laws multiplying (child safety, impact assessments, meaningful human review)

**What This Means for Helm**:
- Customer service AI needs regulatory guardrails
- Helm's decision traces and governance features become **compliance infrastructure**
- Companies that can demonstrate "meaningful human review" win with regulators

**Helm's Narrative**:
> "Regulatory pressure intensifies in 2026. EU AI Act takes full effect. Helm isn't just operational; it's compliance infrastructure. Every decision trace is auditable. Every agent action has human context."

---
