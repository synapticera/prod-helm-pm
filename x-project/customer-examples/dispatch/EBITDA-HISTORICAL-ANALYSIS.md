## Implications for CS Optimization Model

The **27.8% baseline EBITDA margin** used in the CS Impact Model reflects:
- **Current performance**, not historical weakness
- **Strong operational improvement** already achieved in 2025
- **Further optimization potential** exists, particularly in retention/churn reduction

The CS optimization scenarios project EBITDA margin improvement from:
- **Current**: 27.8%
- **Conservative**: 30.6% (+2.7 points)
- **Moderate**: 33.6% (+5.8 points)
- **Aggressive**: 36.7% (+8.9 points)
- **Transform**: 40.6% (+12.8 points)

These represent **incremental gains** on top of the already strong 2025 performance.

## Data Limitations

**Note**: Unable to extract complete monthly trend data for all 12 months of 2025 from the current file structure. The Executive Summary shows December snapshots only.

To get quarterly trends, would need:
- Monthly P&L sheets with clearer labeling
- Or access to source accounting system
- Or separate quarterly summary report

**Current analysis based on**:
- December 2024 vs December 2025 month-over-month comparison
- Year-end run rate extrapolation
