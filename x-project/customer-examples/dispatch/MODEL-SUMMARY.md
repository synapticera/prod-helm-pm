## Scenario Impact Summary

| Scenario | Cost Savings | Revenue Impact | New EBITDA | EBITDA Margin | EV Increase | EV % Gain |
|----------|--------------|----------------|------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Conservative** | $0.5M | $0.4M | $8.0M | 30.6% | **$16.3M** | 17% |
| **Moderate** | $1.1M | $1.0M | $9.1M | 33.6% | **$35.6M** | 37% |
| **Aggressive** | $1.6M | $1.8M | $10.2M | 36.7% | **$57.3M** | 60% |
| **Transform** | $2.4M | $2.8M | $11.7M | 40.6% | **$84.2M** | 88% |

---

## Key Drivers

### Cost Reduction
- **Headcount Efficiency**: 10-45% reduction through AI automation
- **PS Automation**: 15-60% efficiency gain in implementation/onboarding
- **Per-ticket Cost**: 25-70% reduction via self-service and deflection

### Revenue Protection & Growth
- **Churn Reduction**: 1.0-6.0 percentage point improvement (from 11.6% baseline)
- **NRR Enhancement**: 0.5-5.0 percentage point improvement (from 101.7% baseline)
- **Customer Satisfaction**: 5-25 point CSAT improvement

## Valuation Methodology

**Blended Enterprise Value** = Average of:
1. Revenue-based: Annual Revenue × Revenue Multiple
2. EBITDA-based: Annual EBITDA × EBITDA Multiple

### Multiples by Scenario

| Scenario | EV/Revenue | EV/EBITDA |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Baseline | 4.0x | 12.0x |
| Conservative | 4.5x | 13.0x |
| Moderate | 5.0x | 14.0x |
| Aggressive | 5.5x | 15.0x |
| Transform | 6.0x | 16.0x |

**Note**: These multiples are ASSUMPTIONS based on general SaaS market ranges. Higher multiples reflect improved quality of earnings (better retention, higher margins, more predictable revenue).

**CRITICAL**: These multiples are NOT sourced from recent market data or comparables. You should update yellow cells in Sheet 3 with actual market multiples for accuracy.

## Model Sheets

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview with scenario comparison
2. **Baseline Metrics** - Detailed current state financials
3. **Scenario Assumptions** - Editable parameters (YELLOW CELLS = user inputs)
4. **Detailed Calculations** - Full breakdown of scenario impacts
5. **Key Insights** - Strategic recommendations and implementation approach

---

## How to Use This Model

1. **Review Current State** (Sheet 1) - Validate baseline assumptions
2. **Adjust Assumptions** (Sheet 3) - Edit yellow cells to customize scenarios
3. **Review Calculations** (Sheet 4) - See how improvements flow through
4. **Read Insights** (Sheet 5) - Strategic recommendations

### Editable Assumptions (Sheet 3 - Yellow Cells)
- Operational improvement percentages
- Churn reduction targets
- NRR improvement goals
- Valuation multiples

---

## Limitations & Caveats

### Data Limitations
1. **CS Cost Allocation**: Estimated at 60% of G&A, 30% of Sales, 40% of Support Engineering
   - These percentages are ASSUMPTIONS, not from Dispatch's actual cost accounting

2. **Improvement Percentages**: Based on general industry claims for AI/automation
   - NOT derived from Dispatch-specific pilots or benchmarks
   - Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive ranges are judgment-based

3. **Valuation Multiples**: Generic SaaS market ranges
   - NOT based on recent comps or Dispatch's specific sector
   - Should be replaced with actual market data

### Methodological Notes
- Revenue flow-through to EBITDA assumed at 75% (high-margin incremental revenue)
- 3-year cumulative benefit uses 2.5x multiplier for revenue impact (compounds over time)
- Churn and NRR improvements assumed to be maintained (not one-time)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Validate CS Cost Allocation**: Get actual breakdown of support costs from Dispatch
2. **Source Valuation Multiples**: Pull recent SaaS transaction data or public comps
3. **Benchmark Improvements**: Find case studies with measured AI/automation impacts
4. **Scenario Refinement**: Work with Dispatch to calibrate realistic improvement targets
5. **Implementation Planning**: Develop phased rollout plan with measurable milestones

## Questions for Validation

- What percentage of G&A is actually customer support?
- What's the current support ticket volume and cost per ticket?
- What CS tools/platforms are currently in use?
- What's the current CSAT/NPS score?
- Are there existing AI pilots or automation initiatives?
