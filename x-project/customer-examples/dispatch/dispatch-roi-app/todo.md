1) Regarding the median compare on tab 1, Please move the value, the percentage value of how it compares. Make it left justified in the medium column and make it before the little graphic. That way we don't have to worry about any overlapping .. Center the value and the graphic in the overall column, verse median, so it's clear it all works together. Make the gray median line in the little graphic lighter. I cut the width of points in half. 

2) on tab 1, move % of total 30px closer to Amount. 

3) center "Current Spend" over Amount and % of Total
