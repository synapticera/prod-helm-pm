## Optimization Scenarios

### Two Approaches Analyzed

#### 1. **Full Optimization** (Cost + Retention)
Improves both cost efficiency AND customer retention/expansion

#### 2. **Cost-Only** (Conservative)
Focuses purely on cost reduction, holds churn/NRR constant

---

## Full Optimization Scenarios (Cost + Retention)

| Scenario | Cost Savings | Revenue Impact | New EBITDA | Margin | EV Increase | EV % Gain |
|----------|--------------|----------------|------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Conservative** | $0.5M | $0.4M | $8.0M | 30.6% | **$16.3M** | 17% |
| **Moderate** | $1.1M | $1.0M | $9.1M | 33.6% | **$35.6M** | 37% |
| **Aggressive** | $1.6M | $1.8M | $10.2M | 36.7% | **$57.3M** | 60% |
| **Transform** | $2.4M | $2.8M | $11.7M | 40.6% | **$84.2M** | 88% |

**Key Drivers**:
- Headcount efficiency: 10-45% reduction
- PS automation: 15-60% efficiency gain
- **Churn reduction**: 1.0-6.0 percentage points (from 11.6%)
- **NRR improvement**: 0.5-5.0 percentage points (from 101.7%)

## Cost-Only Scenarios (Churn/NRR Constant)

| Scenario | Total Savings | New EBITDA | Margin | EV Increase | EV % Gain |
|----------|---------------|------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Conservative** | $0.5M | $7.8M | 29.9% | **$5.2M** | 5.5% |
| **Moderate** | $1.1M | $8.3M | 32.0% | **$10.7M** | 11.2% |
| **Aggressive** | $1.6M | $8.9M | 34.1% | **$16.4M** | 17.2% |
| **Transform** | $2.4M | $9.6M | 36.9% | **$23.7M** | 24.9% |

**Key Advantages**:
- Lower execution risk (cost reduction more predictable)
- No dependency on customer behavior changes
- Faster payback (3-8 months)
- Can layer on retention initiatives later
- Conservative valuation (4.0x revenue, 12.5-14.0x EBITDA)

## Comparison: Full vs Cost-Only

| Metric | Conservative (Full) | Conservative (Cost-Only) | Difference |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Total Savings | $0.5M | $0.5M | Same |
| Revenue Impact | $0.4M | $0 | -$0.4M |
| EBITDA Increase | $0.8M | $0.5M | -$0.3M |
| EV Increase | $16.3M | $5.2M | **-$11.1M** |

**The retention component** (churn reduction + NRR improvement) drives **$11M in additional EV** in the Conservative scenario alone.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Option A: **Cost-Only First** (Lower Risk)
1. **Phase 1** (Months 1-6): Deploy AI ticket deflection & agent assist
2. **Target**: 15-20% cost reduction ($543K-$1.1M savings)
3. **Payback**: 3-6 months
4. **EV Impact**: $5-11M (6-11% increase)
5. **Then**: Layer on retention initiatives in Phase 2

### Option B: **Integrated Approach** (Higher Upside)
1. **Launch**: Cost reduction + proactive CS simultaneously
2. **Target**: Moderate scenario ($35.6M EV increase)
3. **Investment**: ~$750K
4. **Payback**: 8-9 months
5. **3-Year Value**: $8M+ cumulative benefit

### Recommendation: **Start with Cost-Only, Add Retention**
- Implement AI automation for immediate cost savings (lower risk)
- Use efficiency gains to fund retention programs
- Measure retention impact over 6-9 months
- Scale based on proven retention ROI

## Valuation Methodology Note

**IMPORTANT**: EV multiples used are **ASSUMPTIONS**, not market data:
- Revenue Multiple: 4.0-6.0x (higher for better scenarios)
- EBITDA Multiple: 12.0-16.0x (higher for better margins)

These should be replaced with:
- Recent SaaS transaction comps
- Public company trading multiples
- Dispatch's specific sector benchmarks

**Edit yellow cells in Sheet 3** to update with actual market multiples.

## Next Steps for Validation

1. **Validate CS Cost Allocation**: Is 14% of revenue actually customer support?
2. **Get Ticket Metrics**: Current volume, cost per ticket, FCR rate
3. **Source Multiples**: Pull recent SaaS valuation data for field service sector
4. **Benchmark Improvements**: Find case studies with measured AI/automation ROI
5. **Pilot Approach**: Consider 3-month pilot to validate assumptions before full rollout
