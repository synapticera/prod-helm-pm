## The 3-Plane Architecture

Forrester defines enterprise agent deployment as requiring three layers:

### 1. Build Plane

- Where agents are created and deployed
- Focus: Agent capability, speed, training
- Current market focus (agents themselves)

### 2. Orchestration Plane

- Where agent work is organized and routed
- Focus: Workflow, task sequencing, integration
- Emerging market focus

### 3. Control Plane

- Where agent decisions are governed and monitored
- Focus: Policy enforcement, governance, transparency, compliance
- **THIS IS THE NEXT MARKET OPPORTUNITY**

## Key Finding

**"You cannot trust agents to police themselves; you need an external governance layer"**

This validates the core problem Helm solves:

- Agents make decisions autonomously
- Organizations need visibility into those decisions
- Companies need ability to set policies and guardrails
- Compliance requires audit trails

## Control Plane Market Opportunity

### What Enterprises Need

- Real-time visibility into agent decision-making
- Policy-based governance (rules, guardrails, exceptions)
- Audit trails for compliance (EU AI Act, SOX, etc.)
- Continuous learning from decision outcomes

### Why It's Urgent

- 40% of enterprise apps deploying agents by end 2026
- Regulators (EU AI Act) mandating decision governance by August 2, 2026
- Companies realizing agents can't self-regulate
- Need for systematic decision intelligence infrastructure
