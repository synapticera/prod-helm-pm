# Foundation Capital: Systems of Agents Will Collapse the Enterprise Stack (2025)

**Date**: January 2025 - January 2026
**Source**: Foundation Capital (VC Firm)
**Category**: VC Thesis - Market Transformation
**Relevance**: Validates Helm's positioning as infrastructure layer for the "Systems of Agents" future; explains urgency of governance/context capture

## The Core Thesis

**"Systems of Agents will collapse the entire enterprise software stack built over four decades."**

Foundation Capital argues that autonomous AI entities that capture, understand, and act on business communication will dismantle traditional enterprise software categories (Systems of Record, Systems of Engagement, Systems of Intelligence) into a single, cohesive agent-native system.

### Key Quote

> "Systems of Agents will begin by automating human workflows, initially coexisting with all existing systems. As they capture and act on information at its source... they'll generate richer, more accurate data than traditional systems ever could."

## The Three-Layer Collapse Mechanism

Foundation Capital identifies the **order of disruption**:

### 1. Systems of Intelligence Collapse FIRST

**Current Problem**: Intelligence systems depend on manual data entry and structured databases

- Sales forecasting in traditional systems: Wait for reps to update pipeline
- AI agent alternative: Detect deal signals automatically (CFO cc'd, legal involvement, budget approval language) without manual updates

**Why Agents Win**:

- Understand full business context in real-time
- Bypass "garbage in, garbage out" problem of traditional analytics
- No waiting for humans to input data

**Key Insight**: After 7+ years, no $1B revenue company exists in the Systems of Intelligence space—"the approach is fundamentally flawed"

### 2. Systems of Engagement Collapse SECOND

**Current Problem**: Platforms like Slack, Teams, Zoom create sprawling, unusable data silos

- Recruitment communication happens across email, LinkedIn, Slack, Zoom, phone calls
- No platform captures the full conversation thread or decision context

**Why Agents Win**:

- Synthesize information across all communication channels naturally
- Example: ConverzAI handles entire recruitment communication journey across channels
- Eliminates need for multiple specialized tools

**Result**: Multiple engagement tools collapse into single agent orchestrating all channels

### 3. Systems of Record Collapse LAST

**Current Problem**: Database systems (SAP, Oracle, Salesforce) require rigid data entry into structured fields

- Customer record = manual entry of name, title, company, deal size
- Medical record = manual clinical documentation into EHR
- Invoice = manual data entry from supplier documents

**Why Agents Win**:

- Automatically structure unstructured communication
- Example: Tennr's medical records system processes patient information without manual EHR entry
- Superior data quality (full context captured vs. just key fields)

**Result**: "SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce, beware"—Systems of Record become redundant when agents capture data at source

## Foundation Capital's Supporting Theses

### 1. Context Graphs = The Trillion-Dollar Opportunity

**Definition**: A living record of decision traces stitched across entities and time so precedent becomes searchable.

**What Gets Captured**:

- **Rules**: General policies ("use official ARR for reporting")
- **Decision Traces**: Specific instances showing how rules were applied, exceptions granted, conflicts resolved
- **Precedent**: Searchable library of past decisions enabling agents to handle edge cases

**Why It Matters for Agents**:

- Agents need decision lineage to operate autonomously
- Structural advantage belongs to "systems-of-agents startups that sit in the execution path"
- They can capture context at decision time, not after-the-fact
- This builds the next generation of Systems of Record focused on **decisions, not just objects**

**TAM**: $1 Trillion opportunity to build organizational memory and decision infrastructure

### 2. Service as Software: The $4.6T Opportunity

**Market Size Comparison**:

- Traditional SaaS market: ~$200B annually
- **Services as Software TAM**: $4.6T annually (enterprises' salary + outsourced services spend)
- **Implication**: AI-native agents targeting labor replacement, not just labor acceleration

**Shift in Value Delivery**:

- **Old Model**: "Better workflow tools" (Slack is 10x faster at messaging)
- **New Model**: "Digital workers that replace humans" (AI agent replaces sales development rep entirely)

**Implementation as Product**:

> "Integration is not a post-sale activity. It is the product surface."

Success requires:

- Forward-deployed engineers customizing workflows
- Deep customer-specific implementation expertise
- Outcome-based pricing aligned with actual value (labor hours replaced)
- Not feature parity, but execution depth

### 3. Collapse of Software Primitives

Foundation Capital notes that "AI has accelerated the collapse of software primitives"—basic capabilities that once differentiated software are now commoditized:

- Data triage
- Structured tables & search
- Routing & workflow logic
- Natural language interfaces

**Implication**: Competitive advantage shifts from features to **integration depth and execution quality**

## Timeline & Maturity Signals

Foundation Capital provides **no explicit timeline** but offers these signals:

### 2025-2026 Portfolio Evidence

- **Regie**: AI agents for sales development
- **Oliv AI**: Accounts payable automation
- **ConverzAI**: Multi-channel recruitment
- **Tennr**: Medical records without manual EHR entry
- **Eightfold**: Talent intelligence

All demonstrate proof-of-concept that agents can execute functions without human workflows.

### Market Signal: The Intelligence Gap

- 7+ years since "Systems of Intelligence" category emerged
- No $1B revenue company exists in category
- Suggests the approach is broken—agents will replace it

### Incumbent Response

- Salesforce (Feb 2024) announced "Foundations" to unbundle features across tiers
- SAP, Oracle racing to add agent capabilities
- But **structural problem**: Built on data entry paradigm; agents bypass this entirely

## Implications for Helm's Positioning

### Why Helm Fits This Framework

**Current Reality (Foundation Capital's Thesis)**:

- Agents are automating at scale
- They're generating superior decision data
- But they need governance, context, and decision lineage
- No company is building the infrastructure layer

**Helm's Opportunity**:

- **Mine**: Captures decision traces as agents execute (sitting in the execution path)
- **Design**: Builds context graphs of decision patterns (enabling next agent generation)
- **Manage**: Enforces policies, captures outcomes, enriches context graph

**Structural Advantage**:

- Captures context at decision time (not after-the-fact analytics)
- Builds defensible moat from decision data network effects
- Positioned between agents and execution (perfect information capture point)

### What Helm Must Own

According to Foundation Capital's framework, Helm should position as:

- **"The Decision Context Layer for Service Agents"**—not "AI management tool"
- Emphasize decision traces, precedent learning, outcome capture
- Position context graphs as competitive moat (Salesforce owns customer data; Helm owns decision data)

## How This Affects Customer Service Vertical

### Service Operations Transformation

**Old Stack** (Systems of Record → Engagement → Intelligence):

1. CSR manually enters customer info into Salesforce
2. CSR discusses resolution via Slack/email/phone
3. Analytics dashboard shows resolution time, CSAT score (days later)

**New Stack** (Systems of Agents)\*\*:

1. Agent handles customer inquiry across channels (email, chat, knowledge base)
2. Decision context automatically captured (why was escalation made? what knowledge was used?)
3. Next agent learns from precedent immediately

**Helm's Role**:

- Captures decision traces in real-time (Mine)
- Builds governance policies from patterns (Design)
- Ensures agents follow policies + compliance requirements (Manage)
- Each customer's decision data improves all customers' agents (network effects)

---

## Competitive Implications

### Why Incumbents Are Trapped

**Salesforce Problem**:

- Built on "customer data = competitive advantage"
- But agents bypass Salesforce entirely if they can read emails + docs directly
- "Better Salesforce" (faster UI, more fields) doesn't compete with agents that don't use Salesforce

**SAP/Oracle Problem**:

- Built on "structured data entry = compliance"
- But agents capturing data at source = better compliance automatically
- "Bigger database" doesn't beat "no manual data entry"

### Why Helm Could Win

If positioned correctly as "Context Layer for Service Agents":

- Not threatened by incumbent software (agents will use multiple systems)
- Captures value at the **decision point** (highest-value data)
- Network effects: More service agents → better decision precedents → better agents

## Critical Insight: Integration is the Product

Foundation Capital emphasizes:

> "The prize isn't feature parity or UI elegance. It's execution depth. Integration is the product surface."

**For Helm**: This means:

- Mine module's value isn't "pretty dashboards" but "complete decision understanding"
- Design module's value isn't "workflow builder" but "governance that works with diverse agent types"
- Manage module's value isn't "monitoring" but "continuous learning that improves next 1000 agent interactions"

This explains why "generic AI management tools" lose to vertical specialists—execution depth in service operations becomes the moat.

## Summary: Foundation Capital's World

**If Foundation Capital is right**:

1. Enterprise software as we know it is obsolete (5-10 year replacement cycle)
2. Agents will disrupt Systems of Intelligence first, then Engagement, then Records
3. Winner will be who captures and owns decision context first
4. $4.6T labor market will shift to outcome-based pricing (not seat-based)
5. Integration depth and domain specialization are only defensible moats

**Helm's Position**:

- Perfectly positioned to own decision context layer for service vertical
- Can build defensible moat from decision traces (network effects)
- Must position as infrastructure (context graphs) not tool (executive dashboards)
- Should emphasize governance + learning + compliance (not reporting)
