## Overview: Three Independent Validation Points

Three major research organizations—MIT, McKinsey, and Bain—independently identified the same core insight: **AI execution is now table stakes. The constraint is governance, decision intelligence, and organizational execution.**

While they use different terminology and focus on different aspects, all three validate Helm's positioning and the massive market opportunity:

| Source       | Terminology          | Core Finding                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MIT CISR** | Stage 2→3 Transition | 34% stuck in pilot; transition requires executive function infrastructure |
| **McKinsey** | Workflow Redesign    | Only 39% seeing EBIT impact; workflow redesign is #1 success factor       |
| **Bain**     | Agentic Governance   | Governance + decision intelligence foundational for safe agent deployment |

---

## Finding #1: Enterprise AI Scaling Is Stalled (MIT, McKinsey, Bain Agree)

### MIT Says:

- **Stage 2 (Build Pilots)**: 34% of enterprises stuck here (pilot mode, not scaling)
- **Stage 3 (Scale Operations)**: Only 46% have reached this stage (up from 31% in 2022)
- **The Gap**: Stage 2→3 transition requires solving executive function layer

### McKinsey Says:

- **Scaling Programs**: Only ~33% have begun scaling AI programs
- **62% engaged with agents**, but **only 23% actually scaling** agentic systems
- **39% see EBIT impact** despite 88% using AI regularly
- **The Gap**: Deployment exists, but enterprise-level ROI doesn't

### Bain Says:

- **Agentic AI progression**: Companies at Levels 2-3 (single-task and cross-system workflows)
- **Most companies not ready**: Lack foundational governance and data infrastructure
- **The Gap**: Technology exists, but organizational readiness is incomplete

### Synthesis:

**All three sources agree on the same phenomenon from different angles:**

- Companies can deploy AI and agents (execution is solved)
- But they can't scale AI to enterprise-level ROI (governance is unsolved)
- ~2/3 of companies stuck in this gap
- TAM: Enormous (all companies attempting to scale)

## Finding #2: Governance & Decision Intelligence Are Foundational (Bain, MIT, McKinsey)

### Bain Explicitly States:

> "As agents take on more decision-making, governance and controls must evolve. Real-time explainability, behavioral observability, and adaptive security are essential."

- Governance must be built in from day 1, not retrofitted
- Distributed model: central governance + domain oversight
- Human-in-the-loop is current production reality

### MIT Identifies:

**Four Critical Challenges for Stage 2→3 Progression:**

1. **Strategy**: Can't align AI investments with strategic goals → Need decision context capture
2. **Systems**: Lack modular, interoperable platforms → Need governance layer
3. **Synchronization**: Workforce not ready → Need transparency and governance frameworks
4. **Stewardship**: Compliance and transparency afterthought → Need audit trails and governance

### McKinsey Finds:

- High performers 3x more likely to have senior leadership aligned on AI strategy
- Workflow redesign (which requires governance) has biggest impact on EBIT
- Risk management escalating (companies managing 2x more risks)

### Synthesis:

**Governance is not optional feature—it's foundational infrastructure that separates:**

- Winners (5-7x better outcomes) from losers (95% failure rate)
- Enterprise-scale impact from use-case-level benefits
- Leaders from laggards (3x difference in agent scaling)

---

## Finding #3: Workflow Redesign Is Critical Success Factor (McKinsey, Bain, MIT Imply)

### McKinsey Explicit Finding:

> "The redesign of workflows has the biggest effect on an organization's ability to see EBIT impact from its use of gen AI."

- Simply deploying agents ≠ productivity gains
- Workflow redesign around agent capabilities = EBIT impact
- Companies skip redesign and capture only use-case benefits

### Bain Principle:

- "Redesign entire workflows (not isolated use cases)"
- Domain-specific platforms enable workflow optimization
- One-size-fits-all fails because workflows vary by domain

### MIT Implication:

- Stage 3 success requires "industrializing deployments" (repeatable processes)
- "Platform-based approach" (not one-off projects)
- This requires systematic workflow redesign

### Synthesis:

**Workflow redesign is the bridge between deployment and ROI:**

- Agents deployed in isolation = use-case benefits only
- Agents deployed with redesigned workflows = enterprise ROI
- Most companies skip redesign → 61% not seeing EBIT impact despite deployment

---

## Finding #4: Regulatory Tailwind & Compliance Infrastructure (MIT, Bain, McKinsey)

### MIT Research:

- EU AI Act full implementation August 2, 2026
- Requires "meaningful human review" and transparent decision lineage
- Creates compliance inflection that Helm addresses natively

### Bain Identifies:

- "Adaptive security" and "behavioral observability" required
- Audit trails for decision transparency
- Compliance non-negotiable as agents take on decisions

### McKinsey Notes:

- Risk management escalating (2x more risks in 2025 vs 2022)
- 60% of Fortune 100 appointing Chief AI Officer (need governance tools)
- Governance becoming mandatory infrastructure

### Synthesis:

**Regulatory environment is shifting governance from "nice-to-have" to "mandatory":**

- EU AI Act deadline: August 2, 2026 (7 months away)
- Creates urgency for governance infrastructure
- Compliance becomes competitive advantage (not just cost)

---

## Finding #5: Market Timing Is NOW (All Three Sources Agree)

### MIT Shows:

- Stage 3-4 adoption accelerating (31%→46% and 7%→18% in 3 years)
- Agentic AI acceleration making governance urgent
- Window of opportunity: next 12-18 months

### McKinsey Indicates:

- 40% of enterprise apps will have agents by end of 2026
- Major vendors entering agentic space (H1 2025)
- Competitive advantage goes to execution leaders
- EBIT gap creates Q2-Q3 2026 urgency for solutions

### Bain Implies:

- Companies allocating 5-10% of tech spend for 3-5 years
- Consistent, substantial budget for agentic infrastructure
- First-mover advantage in governance platforms

### Synthesis:

**The market inflection is happening in real-time:**

- Agent adoption moving mainstream in 2026
- Governance and decision intelligence becoming critical infrastructure
- Enterprise budgets flowing to solutions enabling scale
- First-mover advantage in category definition is valuable

## Validation: Helm's Core Thesis

### Helm's Thesis:

"Executive Agent Platform for Service Leaders—providing the executive function layer that separates winners from those wasting 90% of their opportunity"

### MIT Validates:

- ✅ Stage 2→3 transition is the inflection point
- ✅ Transition requires executive function infrastructure (what Helm does)
- ✅ Financial impact is massive (+11-17pp profitability advantage)
- ✅ 34% of enterprises ready for this solution

### McKinsey Validates:

- ✅ Workflow redesign is #1 success factor (Helm's Design module)
- ✅ Only 39% seeing enterprise ROI (61% gap = market)
- ✅ High performers have executive alignment (Helm enables this)
- ✅ Risk management escalating (Helm's governance addresses this)

### Bain Validates:

- ✅ Governance must be foundational (Helm's architecture)
- ✅ Domain specialization wins (Helm for Customer Service)
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop is production reality (Helm's escalation policies)
- ✅ Workflow redesign around agent capability is critical (Helm's Design)

---

## TAM Validation: Market Is Large

### MIT Shows:

- Stage 2→3 transition is $1T+ productivity opportunity
- 34% of enterprises in pilot phase = 48,000+ companies (US) + global
- Financial impact: 24pp profitability swing = $120M+ per large enterprise

### McKinsey Indicates:

- 62% of enterprises engaged with agents (growing rapidly)
- 61% not seeing enterprise-level ROI (market for solutions)
- Workflow redesign is #1bottleneck (TAM for Design services)

### Bain Implies:

- 5-10% of tech spending for 3-5 years = consistent budget flow
- Domain-specific platforms in each vertical = multiple markets
- Customer service is largest AI deployment use case

---

## Competitive Dynamics: Why Helm Wins

### Why Incumbents Lose:

- **Salesforce**: Agent-focused, not decision-intelligence focused (Bain, McKinsey)
- **Consulting firms**: One-size-fits-all, not domain-specialized (Bain, MIT)
- **Legacy vendors**: Process-mining focused, not governance-focused

### Why Helm Wins:

- **Domain specialization**: Customer Service specialization (Bain validates)
- **Governance native**: Built-in from day 1 (Bain/McKinsey validate)
- **Workflow redesign**: Core capability (McKinsey validates)
- **First-mover**: Claiming "Executive Agent" category early (all three validate timing)

---

## Positioning Implications: What This Means

### From MIT:

**"Help enterprises move from pilots to scaled AI operations"**

- Mine: Capture current decision patterns (baseline for strategy)
- Design: Model optimal future state with agents integrated
- Manage: Govern and monitor at scale

### From McKinsey:

**"Enable workflow redesign around agent capabilities to unlock EBIT impact"**

- Design module directly addresses this need
- Service leaders need visibility to understand impact

### From Bain:

**"Provide foundational governance and decision intelligence for agentic AI"**

- Manage module provides explainability, observability, governance
- Domain-specialization in customer service (not generic)

### Combined Message:

**"Helm is the executive function layer that enables enterprises to move from pilots to scaled, profitable AI deployment—starting with customer service leaders."**
