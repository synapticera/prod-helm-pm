# Velocity Gap & J-Curve — Helm Pitch Integration

**Purpose:** How to use Cognizant's Velocity Gap research in Helm investor and customer conversations
**Created:** 2026-02-07

---

## Why This Is Central to Our Pitch

The Cognizant Velocity Gap research provides **third-party validation** of Helm's entire reason for existing:

| Cognizant Finding | Helm Connection |
|------------------|----------------|
| Infrastructure sprinting, value walking | Helm bridges this gap for customer service leaders |
| J-Curve: enterprises in the "dip" phase | Helm accelerates through the dip to breakthrough |
| "Methodologies and tools to harness AI are only just emerging" | **Helm IS the methodology and tool** |
| "You can't apply this technology on existing old processes" | Helm's MINE + DESIGN modules = process reinvention |
| $650B/year revenue needed for 10% ROI | Without Helm-like platforms, that ROI never materializes |
| Context engineering is critical | Helm provides cross-domain context (Systems, Process, Data, Team, Financial) |
| 93% of jobs impacted NOW, not 2032 | Urgency — leaders need Helm TODAY, not in 3 years |

## Pitch Narrative: The J-Curve Story

### Opening (The Problem)
> "Cognizant just published research showing that $5 trillion in AI infrastructure investment is racing ahead, but enterprise value realization is barely walking. They call it the Velocity Gap. JP Morgan says we need $650 billion in new annual revenue just to earn a 10% return on what's been invested."

### The Pattern (Credibility)
> "This isn't new — electrification, mainframes, fiber optics all followed the same J-Curve. Massive investment, a painful dip, then breakthrough. We're in the dip right now. The question is: who helps enterprises get through it faster?"

### The Answer (Helm)
> "That's exactly what Helm does. We're the executive command center that shows service leaders what they can't see — so they can bridge the velocity gap in their operations. Not by deploying more AI tools, but by providing the decision intelligence layer that turns investment into value."

### The Proof Point
> "Cognizant's own CEO said 'the methodologies and tools to harness AI are only just emerging.' He's right — and Helm is that methodology. We provide the MINE, DESIGN, and MANAGE framework that takes leaders from blind spot to breakthrough."

## Key Stats for Slides / Conversations

### The Urgency Stats
- **$4.5T** in US labor value shift — happening now
- **93%** of jobs impacted today (was projected for 2032)
- **6 years** ahead of schedule
- **$5T+** infrastructure investment by 2030

### The Gap Stats
- **6-12 months** — AI innovation cycles
- **3-5 years** — Enterprise adoption timelines
- **$650B/year** — Revenue needed for 10% ROI on AI infra (JP Morgan)
- **32%** — Tasks that remain non-automatable (down from 57% in 2023)

### The Acceleration Stats (Exposure Scores)
- Legal: **9% → 63%** (+54pp)
- C-Suite: **25% → 60%** (+35pp)
- Education: **11% → 49%** (+38pp)
- Annual exposure increase: **9%** (was 2%)

### The Human Element
- **40%+** of management/financial/admin tasks cannot be automated
- Humans remain essential for judgment, creativity, relationships
- "Process reinvention required" — can't just apply AI to old processes

## Slide Suggestions

### Slide: "The Velocity Gap" (Market Context)
- Two-speed visual: Infrastructure (6-12 mo cycles) vs Enterprise Value (3-5 year adoption)
- $5T invested ←→ $650B/yr needed for ROI
- "We are in the dip of the J-Curve"

### Slide: "The J-Curve" (Pattern Recognition)
- J-Curve chart with "WE ARE HERE" marker
- Historical parallels sidebar (electrification, fiber, AI)
- Phase 1 (Current): Investment > Returns
- Phase 2 (Emerging): $4.5T opportunity "not yet visible"

### Slide: "Helm Bridges the Gap" (Solution)
- Position Helm as the bridge between infrastructure investment and value realization
- MINE → DESIGN → MANAGE = systematic path through the J-Curve
- "The methodology that turns the velocity gap into velocity"

## Objection Handling

**"Isn't this just hype?"**
> "Cognizant analyzed 18,000 tasks across 1,000 professions. This isn't prediction — it's measurement. 93% job impact that was projected for 2032 is measurably happening today."

**"Why now?"**
> "Three breakthroughs collapsed a decade of change into three years: multimodality, advanced reasoning, and agentic AI. The J-Curve accelerated. Leaders who don't have a command center for this are flying blind."

**"Can't enterprises figure this out themselves?"**
> "Cognizant's CEO said it: 'the methodologies and tools to harness AI are only just emerging.' That's literally what Helm provides — the decision intelligence layer that doesn't exist yet in the market."
