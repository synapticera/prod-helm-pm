## Research Findings: The Emerging Category

### What's Forming

This is a rich article from Ed Sim's newsletter. Let me dig deeper into the key sources and see who else is writing about this emerging "Execution Intelligence Layer" and "Context" category.

There are **multiple names converging on the same concept**, which is actually a great sign that a category is crystallizing:

### Primary Terms Being Used

1. **Context Graphs** (Foundation Capital / Jaya Gupta)
2. **Decision Intelligence** (Gartner, IDC, Quantexa)
3. **Execution Intelligence Layer** (Ed Sim's term)
4. **Enterprise Context Management** (Mark Palmer's framing)
5. **Systems of Record for Decisions** (vs. traditional systems of record for data)

---

## Key Voices & Sources

### Tier 1: Category Definers

**Jaya Gupta & Ashu Garg (Foundation Capital)**
- Published December 22, 2025
- Their piece "Context Graphs: AI's Trillion-Dollar Opportunity" is becoming the foundational reference
- Key insight: "Agents don't just need rules. They need access to the **decision traces** that show how rules were applied, exceptions granted, approvals routed, and alternatives evaluated."

**Ed Sim (Boldstart Ventures)**
- Weekly newsletter "What's Hot in Enterprise IT/VC"
- He's synthesizing across the ecosystem and coining "Execution Intelligence Layer"

**Aaron Levie (Box CEO)**
- "Jevon's Paradox for Knowledge Work"
- His argument: AI won't shrink knowledge work - it will massively expand it because the cost of knowledge work will drop

### Tier 2: Emerging Voices

**Mark Palmer**
- Two Substacks: "Techno Sapien" and "Enterprise Context Management"
- Former CEO, now writing about context as the missing layer

**Gartner**
- Formally recognizing "Decision Intelligence" as an emerging category in their 2025 Hype Cycle for AI

**IDC + Aera Technology**
- Research paper "Accelerating Enterprise Decision Intelligence with AI Agents"
- Claiming 88% of enterprises will adopt decision intelligence by 2027

**theCUBE Research**
- "Agentic AI Futures Index" showing 62% of companies now see AI agents as key to decision-making, but only 15% have governance frameworks

### Tier 3: Ecosystem Commentary

Multiple Substacks and thought pieces are amplifying these ideas:
- Abhi Yadav's "2025 Was the Year AI's Missing Layer Became Obvious"
- Subramanya N's analysis connecting Context Graphs to agentic infrastructure
- Various Medium posts breaking down the Foundation Capital thesis

---

## The Core Thesis (Synthesized)

1. **Systems of record captured WHAT happened** (Salesforce, Workday, SAP)
2. **The new opportunity is capturing WHY it happened** - the decision traces, exceptions, approvals, and precedents
3. **Context ≠ metadata or prompts** - it's decision-time understanding: inputs, intent, constraints, history, permissions, exceptions, alternatives
4. **Startups in the "orchestration path" have structural advantage** - they see full context at decision time, not after the fact via ETL
5. **The feedback loop is the moat** - captured decision traces become searchable precedent, and every automated decision adds another training example

---

## Why This Matters for Helm

This is **exactly** what your Context Framework and archetype-based approach is addressing. Your five dimensions (Systems, Process, Data, Team, Financials) are capturing the context executives need to make decisions - not just reporting on what happened.

The gap you've identified - executives making decisions without visibility across these dimensions - is the same problem Foundation Capital and Ed Sim are identifying at the infrastructure level.

### Strategic Opportunities from This Research

1. **Category alignment**: Consider whether "Decision Intelligence for Customer Service" or "Context Intelligence" resonates more than "Agent Assurance"

2. **Decision traces angle**: Your framework could explicitly capture how executives make decisions - building the "decision record" layer for customer service

3. **The "systems of agents" framing**: Helm sits in the orchestration path for customer service decisions, giving you structural advantage in capturing context

4. **AI-native differentiation**: The thesis is that "AI-first" companies have an edge because they're capturing decision context from day one, not retrofitting onto legacy systems

---

## Who to Watch

If you want to stay on top of this emerging category:

- **Ed Sim's newsletter** - whatshotit.vc (weekly synthesis)
- **Foundation Capital's Ideas page** - foundationcapital.com/ideas
- **Mark Palmer's Substacks** - technosapien.substack.com and enterprisecontextmanagement.substack.com
- **Gartner's Decision Intelligence coverage** - they're formalizing the category

The timing is right. This category is crystallizing **right now**, and you're building exactly what the thesis describes.

## Superagent Research

**User Question:**
> how about superagent?

### What "Superagent" Means

Found several entities using "Superagent" - here's what's out there:

#### 1. Superagent.sh (Y Combinator-backed)

The most notable one - an open-source framework for building, running, and controlling AI agents with guardrails.

**Key positioning:** Guardrails for agentic AI - "Our safety agent integrates with your AI to stop prompt injections, jailbreaks, and data leaks in real time."

**Focus areas:**
- Guard (98% threat detection for prompt injections)
- Verify (grounds outputs against enterprise sources)
- Monitor (visibility into agent behavior)

**Source:** [Help Net Security](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/12/29/superagent-framework-guardrails-agentic-ai/), [Superagent](https://www.superagent.sh/), [GitHub](https://github.com/superagent-ai/superagent)

#### 2. SuperAGI.com

Agentic AI platform focused on CRM/sales automation. Claims 80% reduction in manual data entry, 90% improvement in lead quality.

**Source:** [SuperAGI](https://superagi.com/top-10-agentic-ai-trends-transforming-enterprise-operations-in-2025/)

#### 3. getsuperagent.com

Vertical-specific: "Complete Autonomous AI Workforce for Insurance" - 6 agents available now, 3 more in beta

**Source:** [Getsuperagent](https://getsuperagent.com/)

#### 4. "Super-Agent" as a Category Concept

Emerging terminology for "sophisticated, multi-functional systems capable of managing complex tasks, coordinating workflows, and adapting to changing conditions."

**Architecture layers typically include:**
- Perception Layer (multimodal data)
- Knowledge Layer (ERPs, CRMs, documentation)
- Reasoning Layer (decision-making logic)
- Action Layer (execution and coordination)

**Source:** [Medium - Eastgate](https://medium.com/@eastgate/ai-super-agent-enterprise-growth-with-intelligent-automation-112bc78560c4)

### Analysis

The naming angle is interesting - it's less crowded than you might expect, but "Superagent.sh" has some mindshare in the developer/infrastructure space for agent guardrails.

## Control Plane / Oversight Layer Research

**User Question:**
> what about with clickup and their superagent? wondering if this is an emerging control tier concept?

### This is Gold

**Yes, there's absolutely an emerging category here.**

---

## The Emerging "Control Plane" / "Oversight Layer" Category

### Forrester Just Formalized This (November 2025)

Forrester's research identifies three functional planes:
1. The "build" plane (how to build, deploy, integrate agents)
2. The "observe and operate" plane (monitor, manage, optimize)
3. The "govern" plane (control, compliance, risk management)

**Source:** [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/announcing-our-evaluation-of-the-agent-control-plane-market/)

### The Formal Definition

"An agent control plane is an enterprise control plane that inventories, governs, orchestrates, and monitors AI agents across vendors and platforms."

**Source:** [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/announcing-our-evaluation-of-the-agent-control-plane-market/)

---

## Key Terms Crystallizing Now

### 1. "Agent Control Plane"

**Microsoft, GitHub, Workato, Forrester all using this**

- **Microsoft:** "Agent 365 is the control plane for AI agents. Whether your agents are created with Microsoft platforms or third-party solutions, you need a unified way to discover, manage, and govern them all."
  **Source:** [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-agent-365-the-control-plane-for-ai-agents/)

- **GitHub:** "This is your agent control plane, a suite of enterprise governance features designed to give administrators visibility and control over how AI is used across their organization."
  **Source:** [GitHub](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-enterprise-ai-controls-the-agent-control-plane-are-in-public-preview/)

### 2. "Enterprise Orchestration Layer"

**Salesforce's term**

"The Enterprise Orchestration Layer is the control plane for end-to-end work in an agentic enterprise. It coordinates human and agent collaboration at scale."

**Source:** [Salesforce](https://architect.salesforce.com/fundamentals/agentic-enterprise-it-architecture)

### 3. "Governance Stack"

**Subramanya N's framework**

"The Governance Stack is not a constraint on innovation; it is the foundation that makes innovation sustainable at scale."

**Source:** [Subramanya N](https://subramanya.ai/2025/11/20/the-governance-stack-operationalizing-ai-agent-governance-at-enterprise-scale/)

### 4. "AI Trust Layer"

**UiPath's term**

"The UiPath AI Trust Layer filters and masks PII during model interactions, applies region and data-sovereignty guardrails, and blocks unsafe outputs in real time."

**Source:** [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/blog/product-and-updates/agentic-enterprise-governance-and-security-2025-10-release)

---

## ClickUp's "Super Agent" Architecture

### The Key Distinction

Now back to your original question - ClickUp is positioning differently. They're NOT building a control plane over agents - they're building **agents themselves** that can orchestrate across tools.

"Super Agents in ClickUp are AI coworkers that are built right into your ClickUp Workspace. They should feel like a trusted colleague who knows your work, your workflows, and your team."

**Source:** [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/blog/super-agents-launch/)

"Super Agents combine a few powerful ideas—autonomous decisions, multi-tool orchestration, long-term memory, and natural communication—into a cohesive experience that feels less like a chatbot and more like a capable coworker."

**Source:** [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/blog/hub/ai/agentic-ai/super-agents/)

### Key Architectural Distinction

"The bottleneck to agents transforming how work is done is no longer whether agents can perform well at one skill, but whether they can autonomously orchestrate multiple skills at once."

**Source:** [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251223327889/en/ClickUp-Acquires-Cursor-Competitor-Codegen-to-Supercharge-AI-Super-Agents)

## The Category Map Emerging

| Layer | Function | Who's Playing |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Control Plane / Oversight Layer** | Inventory, govern, monitor, assure agents across vendors | Microsoft Agent 365, GitHub Agent Control Plane, Forrester's "Agent Control Plane Market" |
| **Orchestration Layer** | Coordinate multi-agent workflows, embed in business processes | Salesforce Agentforce, Oracle AI Agent Marketplace |
| **Execution Layer** | The agents themselves doing work | ClickUp Super Agents, SuperAGI, individual copilots |
| **Context/Decision Layer** | Decision traces, reasoning, why things happen | ← This is where Foundation Capital's "Context Graphs" / Ed Sim's "Decision Intelligence" sits |

---

## The Strategic Insight for Helm

Here's the key distinction that matters for your positioning:

### Control Plane
**How do we govern what agents DO?**
- Identity, access, audit trails, compliance
- Monitoring, guardrails, policy enforcement

### Decision Intelligence / Context Layer
**How do we govern what decisions GET MADE and WHY?**
- Decision traces, reasoning chains, exception handling
- The strategic context that informs decisions before agents act

### McKinsey's Insight

McKinsey's "Agentic Organization" piece nails this distinction:

"Just as DevSecOps embedded automated checks into digital delivery, agentic organizations will embed validation and oversight into every agent-driven workflow. The goal isn't to eliminate human judgment - it's to scale it."

**Source:** [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-agentic-organization-contours-of-the-next-paradigm-for-the-ai-era)

And critically: "Human accountability and oversight will remain essential, but their nature will change. Leaders will govern by setting boundaries, validating decisions, and intervening when patterns emerge - not by managing every workflow step-by-step."

## Bottom Line

**"Control Plane"** is emerging as the dominant term for the agent governance layer - but it's primarily focused on **operational governance** (identity, monitoring, compliance).

**What's not yet named** is the **strategic decision layer** - the tier that captures **why** decisions get made, what context informed them, what exceptions were granted, and what alternatives were considered.

### Positioning for Helm

**Helm could own a different position:** Not the control plane (that's Microsoft/GitHub's game), but the **Decision Intelligence Layer for customer service** - where executives get the context they need to make strategic decisions about their operations, transformation, and agent deployment.

Want me to dig deeper into the distinction between operational governance (Control Plane) vs. strategic intelligence (Decision Intelligence)?

## Key Takeaways for Helm Positioning

1. **"Control Plane"** is being claimed by Microsoft, GitHub, Salesforce for **operational governance** of agents
2. **"Decision Intelligence"** / **"Context Graphs"** represent the **strategic layer** - why decisions happen, not just what agents do
3. **Helm sits at the strategic layer** - providing executives with context across domains and horizons to make informed decisions
4. **Timing is perfect** - these categories are crystallizing RIGHT NOW (late 2025 / early 2026)
5. **Multiple credible voices** converging on the same themes - Foundation Capital, Ed Sim (Boldstart), Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey
