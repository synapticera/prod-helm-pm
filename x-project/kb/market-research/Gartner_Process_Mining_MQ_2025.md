# HELM Market Positioning Research
## Strategic Analysis: Gartner/Forrester Customer Service Executive Landscape (January 2026)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research validates a significant **category gap** in the customer service technology market. While vendors compete heavily at the operational layer (CCaaS, agent automation, workflow orchestration), **no vendor has claimed the strategic decision layer for customer service executives**. This creates a first-mover opportunity for HELM to position as the "Decision Intelligence Platform for Customer Service Leaders."

## PART 1: GARTNER CUSTOMER SERVICE LANDSCAPE 2025-2026

### Current Market Categories (Gartner)

| Category | Description | Maturity | Key Players |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS)** | Cloud contact center platforms for voice/digital channels | Mature (Plateau of Productivity) | Genesys, NICE, Talkdesk, Five9, Amazon Connect |
| **Customer Journey Analytics & Orchestration** | Real-time visibility across touchpoints | Emerging | CSG, various |
| **Customer Service Knowledge Management** | AI-powered knowledge for agents/customers | Growing (40% adoption by 2028) | RightAnswers, others |
| **Conversational AI Platforms** | AI chatbots, virtual agents | Peak of Inflated Expectations | Multiple |
| **CRM Customer Engagement Center** | Case management, agent workspace | Mature | Salesforce, Zendesk, etc. |

### Key Gartner Findings (December 2025)

**"Customer Service Leaders Must Prioritize Blending Human Strengths with AI Intelligence in 2026"**

1. **Leaders under pressure to adopt GenAI** - Many executives believe AI = headcount reduction opportunity
2. **95% plan to retain human agents** - Recognizing "digital first, but not digital only" strategy
3. **50% will abandon workforce reduction plans** - AI not a panacea; human touch irreplaceable
4. **Machine Customers emerging** - 51% of customers willing to use GenAI assistant on their behalf

**Three Trends Transforming Customer Service by 2028:**
1. Automation (agentic AI driving toward automated future)
2. AI Assistants (machine customers changing customer relationships)
3. Quest for Value (shifting from demand management to value creation)

### Gartner 2025 Top Priorities for CS Leaders

1. Deploy conversational GenAI for customer interactions
2. Drive enterprise growth through upselling/cross-selling
3. Increase technology literacy among service leaders
4. Optimize knowledge management for AI applications
5. Share customer insights to drive product/service improvements

### Critical Insight: The Strategic Visibility Gap

**Quote from Gartner:** *"The focus of customer service will move from managing demand to value creation, with AI supporting human agents and freeing them for expanded roles. Leaders must prioritize collaboration and value addition across the enterprise, strategically distributing service capabilities and maintaining overarching vision and governance."*

**Translation for HELM:** Gartner is calling for a strategic governance layer that doesn't exist in current market categories. CCaaS handles operations. CRM handles cases. But WHO governs the strategic decisions about how to evolve customer service operations?

## PART 2: THE EXECUTIVE VISIBILITY GAP

### Industry Research Findings

**From Customer Success Collective 2025 Survey:**
> "Career progression remains a sore point. Many CS professionals feel they **lack a seat at the strategic table, with limited visibility into decision-making** and few opportunities to grow."

> "Leadership missteps compound the problem... short-term thinking, **strategic blind spots**, and executives who underestimate the complexity of CS work."

> "When CS is viewed as **tactical rather than strategic**, its ability to influence company direction is inevitably stunted."

**From CustomerThink 2025 Predictions:**
> "Customer service sits on a wealth of insights and a **mostly untapped dataset**. Figuring out how to turn this valuable conversational data into **actionable insights for the organization** can and will positively impact **strategic decisions across all departments**."

> "Service and support functions, traditionally seen as cost centers, will emerge as **strategic growth engines**. Organizations will realize that service data is no longer just operational—it's the **foundation for predictive customer insights, churn prevention, and cross-sell opportunities**."

**From CMSWire 2026 CX Predictions:**
> "The organizations that perform best stop reacting to CX metrics and **start using experience as a strategic operating model**."

> "AI enables real-time personalization and decisioning, but **legacy approval flows, funding models and ownership structures can't keep pace**."

### The Problem HELM Solves

**Current State for CS Executives:**
- Data scattered across CCaaS, CRM, WFM, analytics tools
- Operational metrics (AHT, CSAT, FCR) abundant; strategic context scarce
- Reactive decision-making based on crisis/escalation
- No visibility into "what should we change and why"
- Technology investments made without clear ROI framework
- Future vision disconnected from current operational reality

**What's Missing:**
- Unified view across Process, People, Technology, Finance, Customer dimensions
- Context spanning Current State → Future Vision → Roadmap → Execution
- Benchmark data showing how they compare to peers
- AI-powered recommendations for strategic decisions
- Clear link between operational data and strategic outcomes

### Why This Gap Exists

1. **CCaaS vendors** focus on operational execution (routing, handling, channels)
2. **CRM vendors** focus on case/customer management
3. **Analytics vendors** provide data but not strategic recommendations
4. **Consulting firms** provide strategy but not continuous context
5. **No vendor** provides continuous AI-powered strategic context for CS executives

### Closest Adjacent Categories (None Exact)

| Category | Gartner Definition | Why It's Not HELM |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Decision Intelligence | "Practical discipline that advances decision making by explicitly understanding and engineering how decisions are made" | Horizontal, not CS-specific |
| Customer Journey Analytics | "Real-time visibility and action across touchpoints" | Customer-facing, not executive decision support |
| CCaaS | "Platforms for voice and digital customer channels" | Operational, not strategic |
| AI Governance Platforms | "Visibility, governance, management of AI systems" | AI-focused, not decision-focused |

---

## PART 5: SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

### Gartner Predictions Validating HELM

1. **By 2028:** 40% of large enterprises adopt AI-powered customer service knowledge automation (up from <5% in 2025)
2. **By 2028:** Organizations will shift from "managing demand to value creation"
3. **By 2028:** GenAI, Digital Customer Service, and Conversational UI will transform customer service

### Customer Service Leader Pain Points (Research-Validated)

1. **Lack of strategic visibility** - Can't see across all dimensions
2. **No seat at strategic table** - Viewed as tactical, not strategic
3. **Data silos** - Scattered across multiple operational systems
4. **Technology confusion** - 37% struggle to identify which AI meets business needs
5. **ROI uncertainty** - 27% don't know how to measure AI ROI
6. **Leadership blind spots** - Short-term thinking, lack of strategic vision

### The Shift from Cost Center to Growth Engine

**Industry Consensus (2025):** Customer service is transitioning from "cost center" to "strategic growth engine." This transition requires a new category of tool that provides strategic context—not just operational metrics.

**Quote (CustomerThink):** *"Service data is no longer just operational—it's the foundation for predictive customer insights, churn prevention, and cross-sell opportunities. Leaders who elevate service from a reactive to a proactive function will unlock new revenue streams and improve customer lifetime value."*
