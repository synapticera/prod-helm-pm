  # **Report: The Rise of the Execution Intelligence Layer**

  Date: January 2, 2026

  Topic: Emerging Trends in Enterprise IT & Venture Capital

  ## **Executive Summary**

  A structural shift is occurring in Enterprise IT. We are moving beyond the era of **Systems of Record** (SaaS applications that store data) into the era of **Systems of Decision** (Agentic AI that performs work).

  This transition has exposed a critical infrastructure gap: current software stores *what* happened (state), but not *why* it happened (reasoning). To bridge this gap, a new software category is emerging, referred to by Venture Capitalists as the **"Execution Intelligence Layer"** and by analysts as the **"Agent Control Plane."** This report details the definition of this category, the key voices driving the narrative, and the formal taxonomies established by Gartner and Forrester.

  ## **1. The New Category: Execution Intelligence & Context Graphs**

  ### **The Core Problem**

  Traditional enterprise systems (Salesforce, Workday, SAP) are designed to store **State**.

  - *Example:* "Ticket #123 is closed."
  - *Example:* "Invoice #456 was paid."

  They do not store **Reasoning** or **Context**.

  - *Missing:* "Why was the ticket closed without resolution?" (e.g., The customer stopped responding).
  - *Missing:* "Why was the invoice paid despite being over budget?" (e.g., The VP of Engineering authorized an exception via Slack).

  AI Agents cannot safely execute work without this context. If an agent only sees the "State," it lacks the "tribal knowledge" required to make nuanced business decisions.

  ### **The Solution: The Execution Intelligence Layer**

  This new infrastructure layer sits between human intent and software execution. It captures **"Decision Traces"**—living records of inputs, logic, exceptions, approvals, and outcomes.

  - **Primary Function:** To turn "fuzzy human intent" into "reliable machine action."
  - **Key Concept:** **Context Graphs.** A graph that links people, policies, history, and decisions, making the "why" searchable for AI agents.

  ## **2. Key Industry Voices**

  The narrative for this category is currently being shaped by a convergence of Venture Capitalists and Tech CEOs.

  ### **Ed Sim (Boldstart Ventures)**

  - **Concept:** **"The Execution Intelligence Layer"**
  - **Thesis:** Agents need to move from "demos to systems." This requires a layer that enforces "specs" (boundaries/rules) and records the execution path. He argues this layer is where the actual value of AI will be captured, rather than in the underlying LLM.

  ### **Foundation Capital (Jaya Gupta & Ashu Garg)**

  - **Concept:** **"Context Graphs"**
  - **Thesis:** They predict this will be a "Trillion Dollar Opportunity." They argue that the next generation of enterprise software won't be about better databases, but about "Systems of Decision" that store the organizational context required for autonomy.

  ### **Aaron Levie (CEO, Box)**

  - **Concept:** **"AI-Native Architecture"**
  - **Thesis:** Levie describes a "Jevon’s Paradox for Knowledge Work." He argues we are not just adding AI to existing SaaS but re-architecting the enterprise. In this new world, **Context** becomes more valuable than raw **Data**.

  ### **Ivan Zhao (CEO, Notion)**

  - **Concept:** **"Steam, Steel, and Infinite Minds"**
  - **Thesis:** Zhao focuses on the interface and structural shift. He argues we are moving away from rigid file cabinets (folders/files) toward fluid, context-aware retrieval systems that mirror how the human mind works.

  ## **3. The Analyst Perspective: Forrester & Gartner**

  Major analyst firms have formalized this space in their late 2025/2026 strategic reports, though they use different terminology.

  ### **Forrester: The "Agent Control Plane"**

  Forrester has introduced a 3-plane architecture for the Agentic Era:

  1. **The Build Plane:** Where agents are created (LLMs, hyperscalers).
  2. **The Orchestration Plane:** Where work is executed (Adaptive Process Orchestration).
  3. **The Agent Control Plane:** **(The New Category)**. A "Control Tower" that sits *above* agents to govern them.

  - **Key Takeaway:** Forrester emphasizes **Governance**. They argue you cannot trust an agent to police itself. You need an external layer to enforce policies (e.g., spending limits) and audit the "decision traces" of why an agent took a specific action.

  ### **Gartner: "Decision Intelligence" & "Composite AI"**

  Gartner positions this trend under the discipline of **Decision Intelligence (DI)**.

  - **Agentic AI:** The #1 Tech Trend for 2025.
  - **Decision Intelligence:** The discipline of engineering *how* decisions are made, bridging the gap between Data (Insight) and Agents (Action).
  - **Composite AI:** The technical approach. Gartner advises against relying solely on LLMs (probabilistic). Instead, they advocate for "Composite AI," which combines LLMs with **Knowledge Graphs** and **Rule Sets** (symbolic) to ensure accuracy and safety.

  ## **4. Taxonomy Comparison (The Rosetta Stone)**

  To navigate the market, it is essential to understand how different groups refer to the same underlying infrastructure.

  | **Concept**            | **VC Terminology**           | **Forrester Terminology**            | **Gartner Terminology**         |
  | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
  | **The Layer Name**     | Execution Intelligence Layer | Adaptive Process Orchestration (APO) | Decision Intelligence (DI)      |
  | **The Data Structure** | Context Graph                | Agent Control Plane                  | Knowledge Graph / Composite AI  |
  | **The Core Artifact**  | Decision Traces / Specs      | Governance & Audit Logs              | Decision Modeling               |
  | **Primary Focus**      | **Innovation/Startup Value** | **Governance/Safety**                | **Business Logic/Optimization** |

  ## **5. Conclusion**

  The "Execution Intelligence Layer" represents the missing link in the AI stack. 2024-2025 was the era of the **Chatbot** (retrieving information). 2026 is emerging as the era of the **Agent** (executing work).

  For agents to succeed in the enterprise, they require more than just intelligence; they require **Context**. The companies that build the infrastructure to capture, store, and serve this context—effectively "memory" for the enterprise—will define the next decade of software.
