**Author**: Leslie Joseph, Forrester Research
**Published**: December 4, 2025
**Research Initiative**: Agent Control Plane Market Evaluation

---

## Executive Summary

Forrester analyst Leslie Joseph announces a formal market evaluation of the emerging **Agent Control Plane** category. This represents a critical new infrastructure layer for enterprises managing distributed agent deployments at scale.

The research signals that:

- The market is transitioning from "early and uneven" to formal market definition
- Vendor consolidation around control plane capabilities is beginning
- Enterprise demand for governance infrastructure is accelerating
- Major analysts (Gartner, Forrester) are formalizing category recognition

---

## The Three-Plane Architecture Model

Forrester positions agentic AI technology as an ecosystem aligned with three functional planes:

### 1. Build Plane

**Question**: How do we construct and scale agentic AI systems?

**Focus**:

- Model access and foundation models
- Agent frameworks and development tools
- Infrastructure and tool integration
- Evaluation and testing pipelines

**Market Status**: Commoditizing (many vendors, intense competition)

**Examples**: Claude, GPT, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT frameworks

---

### 2. Orchestration Plane

**Question**: How do we embed agents into business workflows?

**Focus**:

- Adaptive Process Orchestration (APO)
- Process modeling and design
- Task routing and workflow management
- Runtime adaptation based on agent outputs

**Market Status**: Emerging (few dedicated vendors, mostly horizontal platforms)

**Examples**: Make.com, Zapier, specialized workflow automation platforms

---

### 3. Agent Control Plane (Newly Evaluated)

**Question**: How do we govern and manage a distributed agent estate?

**Focus**:

- Visibility across heterogeneous agents
- Governance and policy enforcement
- Management across vendors and domains
- Independent oversight layer

**Market Status**: Early consolidation phase (12-24 months to full market definition)

---

## Why Control Planes Are Emerging Now

### The Governance Imperative

Leslie Joseph makes a critical observation about control plane necessity:

> "Oversight **must** live outside the agent's execution loop so that monitoring, policy enforcement, and intervention remain available — even when an agent or runtime behaves unpredictably."

**Key insight**: Governance cannot be embedded within agent systems. It must operate independently.

### Real-World Precedents

Forrester cites precedents from mature technology ecosystems:

**Airbnb**:

- Built independent experimentation guardrails
- Controlled agent behavior within bounded parameters
- Prevented uncontrolled AI decision-making

**JPMorgan**:

- Established independent model risk governance functions
- Separate from model development teams
- Oversight ensures compliance and safety

**Pattern**: As autonomous systems scale, you need external governance layers that can operate independently of the systems they monitor.

## Core Agent Control Plane Capabilities

Forrester identifies five essential capabilities that define control plane vendors:

### 1. Agent Inventory and Identity Management

- Maintains accurate catalog of all agents
- Tracks agent permissions and capabilities
- Identifies shadow agents (unauthorized deployments)
- Provides governance visibility

### 2. Centralized Policies and Guardrails

- Business policies (cost limits, approval workflows)
- Risk policies (escalation triggers, spending caps)
- Technical policies (data access, tool usage)
- Runtime enforcement (not just deployment-time)

### 3. Continuous Monitoring and Insights

- Real-time visibility into agent behavior
- Performance metrics (accuracy, speed, cost)
- Outcome tracking (did the agent achieve objectives?)
- Anomaly detection (deviations from expected behavior)

### 4. Control and Coordination

- Multi-vendor agent management
- Cross-environment coordination (prod, staging, test)
- Agent-to-agent authentication and authorization
- Ecosystem-wide orchestration

### 5. Risk, Compliance, and Auditing

- Decision trace recording (full context logging)
- Audit trails for compliance and accountability
- Risk assessments and impact analysis
- Regulatory compliance support

## Market Status and Evolution Timeline

### Current State (Q4 2025 / Q1 2026)

Control planes "already exist in an early and uneven form" — meaning:

- Early vendors are emerging
- Capabilities vary widely
- Market definition is still crystallizing
- No clear leaders yet established

### Evolution Timeline

**12-24 Months**: Full market consolidation

- Clear vendor leaders will emerge
- Market definition will solidify
- Analyst categories (Gartner MQ, Forrester Wave) will formalize
- Enterprise buyer consensus on must-have capabilities

**Implications for Helm**:

- Current window is critical for establishing category leadership
- First-mover advantage in vertical specialization (CS) is real
- Analyst briefings now can shape market narrative
- 6-12 month window before incumbents (Salesforce, Microsoft) add capabilities

---

## Vendor Evaluation Framework

Forrester's evaluation will assess vendors across multiple dimensions:

### Functional Completeness

- Do vendors provide all five core capabilities?
- How deep is each capability?
- Are there gaps in agent inventory, policy enforcement, monitoring?

### Vendor Agnosticism

- Does the control plane work with agents from any vendor?
- Can it govern mix of homemade + third-party agents?
- Is it truly platform-independent?

### Maturity and Scale

- How many agents can the system manage?
- Enterprise-grade reliability and uptime?
- Performance at scale?

### Market Traction

- Customer adoption and retention?
- Reference-ability and use cases?
- Revenue and growth trajectory?

### Roadmap and Vision

- Does vendor understand long-term control plane requirements?
- Are they building features enterprises actually need?
- Is strategy aligned with market evolution?

## Strategic Implications for Helm

### 1. Formal Market Signal

Forrester's research announcement means:

- Control planes are no longer "emerging" — they're officially a category
- Analyst attention is driving enterprise awareness
- Vendors positioning in this space will gain credibility

### 2. Timing Window

- Forrester research reports typically come 6-12 months after announcement
- First vendors in the research get early positioning advantage
- Helm should brief Forrester on Agent Control Plane for CS positioning

### 3. Vendor Comparison Coming

- Forrester will formally compare control plane vendors
- Early engagement shapes how your capabilities are assessed
- Being included in research is major credibility builder

### 4. Market Definition Opportunity

- While market is still defining itself, positioning matters
- Helm can help Forrester understand "control plane for vertical" as valid category
- Ed Sim's thesis about vertical specialists winning is directly relevant

## Market Context: Why This Matters

### The Constraint Shift

As Forrester notes, the constraint in agentic AI has shifted:

**2025**: "Can we build agents?" → Solved by Claude, GPT, LangChain
**2026**: "Can we govern agents?" → **This is the emerging constraint**

Companies can deploy agents. What they can't do:

- Answer: "Why did the agent make this decision?"
- Enforce: "The agent must follow these policies"
- Prove: "This agent is compliant with regulations"
- Manage: "We have 50+ agents from different vendors. How do we govern them?"

**This is the Agent Control Plane opportunity.**

### Regulatory Tailwind

EU AI Act (August 2, 2026) requires:

- Meaningful human review of AI decisions
- Transparent decision lineage
- Risk impact assessments

**Control planes become compliance infrastructure.**

### TAM Expansion

Agent Control Planes will be mandatory for enterprises that:

- Deploy agents at scale (40% of apps by 2026)
- Face regulatory requirements
- Need governance and audit trails
- Want to measure AI ROI

## Key Takeaways

1. **Forrester formally recognizes control planes as emerging category** - This validates Helm's positioning

2. **Control planes must sit outside Build and Orchestration planes** - Governance independence is critical requirement

3. **Five core capabilities define the category** - Mine/Design/Manage maps perfectly

4. **Market consolidation happening NOW** - 12-24 month window for category leaders to emerge

5. **Vertical specialization is defensible** - Forrester didn't mandate "horizontal" control planes; "control plane for CS" is valid

6. **Enterprise demand is real** - Airbnb, JPMorgan using independent oversight; proves market need

7. **Analyst attention is accelerating** - Early vendor engagement shapes narrative and category definition
