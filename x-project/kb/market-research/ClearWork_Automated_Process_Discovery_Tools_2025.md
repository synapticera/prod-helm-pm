**Date Extracted:** October 30, 2025

## Executive Summary

Most digital transformation projects fail not because of technology, but because organizations never gain a complete, accurate picture of how work actually happens. Manual discovery sessions can take months and miss critical exceptions. In 2025, automated process discovery and process intelligence platforms enable organizations to automatically map, analyze, and optimize operations with real data.

## What is Automated Process Discovery?

Automated process discovery uses system and user-level data mixed with documentation and user narrative to automatically generate process maps, requirements, and improvement opportunities.

**Key Difference from Traditional Mapping:**
- Traditional: Depends on interviews and static diagrams
- Automated: Combines digital evidence (user actions, event logs, app telemetry) with human input (recorded voice, text, or shared documents)

**Questions Answered:**
- How is work really being done?
- Where are bottlenecks and exceptions?
- What's the gap between policy and practice?
- Where should we automate first?

**Approach:** Hybrid method blending data-driven process mining, human task capture, and narrative context to produce a living operational model.

## 2025 Market Landscape

The market is rapidly maturing. Legacy tools focus on system logs, while newer entrants integrate:
- Human activity capture
- AI analysis
- End-to-end orchestration

## Leading Platform Comparisons

### 1. ClearWork

**Overview:** People-centric process transformation platform that unifies Automated Discovery and Process Intelligence in one solution.

**How It Works:**
- Captures user activity with screen recordings and narration
- Consolidates inputs with system logs and docs
- Generates structured requirements, workflows, and test plans
- Process Intelligence module continuously monitors work patterns
- Surfaces bottlenecks, rework loops, and drift
- Enables ongoing improvement and governance

**Key Benefits:**
- **Fast Discovery:** Evidence-based requirements in days, not months
- **Build-Ready Outputs:** Auto-generated technical specs and user stories
- **Privacy by Design:** Local processing, minimal data retention, no PII stored
- **Continuous Intelligence:** Ongoing monitoring for drift and performance
- **Human + AI:** Combines real work context with automated analysis

**Best Fit:** Enterprises and public-sector organizations seeking unified discovery-to-delivery platform that blends human narrative, user activity, and system data.

### 2. Celonis

**Overview:** Long-standing leader in process mining and pioneer in process intelligence. Excels at reconstructing workflows from system event logs.

**Strengths:**
- Deep integration with ERP/CRM systems
- Powerful analytics and conformance checking
- Mature ecosystem with templates and benchmarking

**Trade-offs:**
- Heavy reliance on structured event logs (limited human context)
- Complex implementation requiring specialists
- Higher cost, longer time to value
- Downstream dependencies require separate tools

**Best Fit:** Large enterprises with complex ERP systems, mature IT infrastructure, and dedicated analytics teams.

### 3. UiPath

**Overview:** Combines RPA, task mining, and process mining within one ecosystem. Discovery tools designed to identify automation candidates and deploy bots quickly.

**Strengths:**
- Tight integration with RPA pipeline
- Task mining for user-level activity capture
- Strong automation governance and orchestration

**Trade-offs:**
- Discovery primarily optimized for automation use cases
- Less emphasis on requirements documentation or handoff
- Overlapping process and task mining tools can create confusion

**Best Fit:** Enterprises heavily invested in UiPath's automation suite wanting discovery tightly linked to RPA pipelines.

### 4. Skan

**Overview:** Emphasizes real-time task capture from human work using lightweight desktop agents.

**Strengths:**
- Rapid deployment (days, not months)
- Real-time visibility into task performance
- Clear view of application usage and handoffs

**Trade-offs:**
- Minimal narrative or contextual input from users
- Limited coverage of system-level events
- Discovery focused on visibility, not transformation readiness

**Best Fit:** Organizations prioritizing operational visibility into human workflows and task automation opportunities.

## Evaluation Criteria

**Key Factors When Choosing a Platform:**

1. **Discovery Speed & Coverage**
   - How quickly can it map real work?
   - Does it capture both system and human activity?

2. **Action-Readiness**
   - Are outputs structured for downstream delivery?
   - Can teams build from the discovery artifacts?

3. **Privacy & Governance**
   - How is user data collected, stored, and protected?

4. **Continuous Intelligence**
   - Does it offer ongoing monitoring and optimization?

5. **Integration & Ecosystem**
   - Does it fit with your existing tech stack and delivery model?

## Market Trends: The New Generation

The market is entering a new phase with a significant shift toward holistic platforms that merge:
- Automated discovery
- Process intelligence
- AI orchestration

**Result:** Continuous clarity, not just one-time insight

**Legacy vs. New Generation:**
- **Legacy (Celonis, UiPath):** Deep enterprise capabilities
- **Fast Human Visibility (Skan):** Quick operational insights
- **New Generation (ClearWork):** Holistic platforms merging discovery, intelligence, and AI orchestration

**ClearWork's Positioning:** Privacy-first, people-centered platform that:
- Automates discovery
- Generates build-ready blueprints
- Grounds AI-driven transformation in reality of how work actually happens

## Strategic Implications

**Key Insight:** Preparing for successful projects is no longer about spending hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars mapping current state. Modern solutions can automate and augment this function, saving countless hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

**Evolution of Approach:**
- From: Manual discovery sessions taking months
- To: Automated, evidence-based discovery in days
- From: Static documentation that's outdated upon completion
- To: Living operational models with continuous monitoring
- From: Analysis paralysis
- To: Build-ready outputs that accelerate transformation

## Competitive Positioning Summary

| Platform | Primary Focus | Key Strength | Main Limitation |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| ClearWork | Unified discovery-to-delivery | Build-ready outputs + continuous intelligence | Newer entrant |
| Celonis | Process mining analytics | Deep ERP integration | Complex, expensive |
| UiPath | RPA-driven discovery | Automation pipeline integration | Limited beyond automation use cases |
| Skan | Real-time task capture | Fast deployment, human workflow visibility | Minimal narrative context |

## Conclusion

The most significant market shift is toward platforms that unify discovery, intelligence, and execution - giving organizations continuous clarity rather than one-time snapshots. ClearWork represents this new generation by combining privacy-first design, people-centered discovery, and AI orchestration grounded in how work actually happens.
