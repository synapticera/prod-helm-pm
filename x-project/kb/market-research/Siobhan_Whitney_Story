Problem: Wants the AI Gain, No Clue & No Money
Profile: Pragmatic grinder, low tech IQ
Wants operational benefit of AI but has no idea where to start and no budget for a planning project
Go getter who is eager to modernize provider support function
Significant business pressure to scale (becoming a service provider)
Recently modernized application platform (Salesforce)
Ad hoc business processes and poor analytics
General lack of operational sophistication
Fragmented decision making and IT governance


Solution: Low Cost Tool That Sheds Light and Data to Being Journey
Hypothesis:  Needs an a free automated tool to educate and enlighten about process and possibilities (pragmatist, low tech IQ)
Phase #1:  Server based process analysis and recommendation (generates intrigue)
Phase #2: Desktop monitoring and analysis for the real insight (small team, can make happen)
