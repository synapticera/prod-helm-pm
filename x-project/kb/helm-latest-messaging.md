## Core Positioning

### Primary Definition

**Helm is an AI-native executive command center that gives service leaders the tailored insight they need to evolve their operations with confidence and impact.**

### Key Positioning Elements

- **AI-Native Architecture**: Built from the ground up with AI at the core, not bolted on
- **Executive Command Center**: Strategic leadership tool, not an operational execution tool
- **For Service Leaders**: Targeted at customer service executives and leaders
- **Tailored Insight**: Personalized, context-aware intelligence
- **Confidence & Impact**: Enables leaders to make decisions with certainty and drive meaningful results

## The Problem Statement

### Executive Challenge: "No One Has Full Command"

**Two Critical Dimensions:**
1. **Horizons**: Short-term operations vs. long-term strategy
2. **Domains**: Systems, Process, Data, Team, Financials, CX, Strategy

**The AI Transformation Challenge:**
- Powerful AI transformation requires **broad command** to connect the dots across domains and over time
- Service leaders face blind spots in either execution or strategy
- Gap between operational tools and strategic decision-making

### The AI ROI Crisis

Statistics driving urgency:
- **95%** of AI pilots deliver zero ROI (MIT)
- **85%** of AI projects fail before proving value (Gartner)
- **78%** using AI see no bottom-line impact (McKinsey)

### Common Trouble Spots Holding Up CS Transformation

1. **ROI model, roadmap & measure**: Ground truth, vision, roadmap, measure
2. **Tech selection & roadmap**: Ground truth, vision, roadmap, measure
3. **Impact of change**: Understanding vs. implementing
