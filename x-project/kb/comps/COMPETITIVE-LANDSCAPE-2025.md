### Why This Matters Now

**The Agent Era Creates a Governance Gap**

- **95%** of AI pilots deliver zero ROI (MIT)
- **85%** of AI projects fail before proving value (Gartner)
- **88%** of organizations use AI regularly, but only **39%** see enterprise-level EBIT impact (McKinsey)

The 49-point gap between AI adoption and value realization is Helm's core market opportunity. Enterprises have "arms and legs" (AI agents, automation tools) but lack the **executive function layer** — the decision intelligence that governs, understands, plans, and measures results.

**Market Timing Validation**

- **VC Convergence**: Foundation Capital ($Trillion Context Graphs thesis), Boldstart (Execution Intelligence Layer), and top VCs all identifying the governance gap
- **Analyst Recognition**: Gartner names Decision Intelligence #1 trend for 2026; Forrester formalizing Agent Control Planes
- **Enterprise Urgency**: McKinsey states "workflow redesign has the biggest effect on EBIT impact" — validating Helm's approach

### Helm's Unique Position

| What Others Do | What Helm Does |
|----------------|----------------|
| BI: Show what happened | Show WHY decisions happen |
| BPM: Automate workflows | Govern agent decisions |
| ITOM: Monitor systems | Executive-level command |
| SI: Project-based transformation | Continuous intelligence |

**Helm provides the Decision Intelligence Layer** — the executive function that sits above operational tools and below strategic leadership, connecting the dots across domains (Systems, Process, Data, Team, Financials) and horizons (short-term operations + long-term strategy).

#### How Helm Relates to BPM

**Overlap**: Both focus on business process optimization and workflow management.

**What Helm Does That BPM Doesn't**:
- **Process Discovery vs. Process Execution**: BPM executes defined workflows; Helm discovers actual work patterns via task mining and process mining
- **Decision Layer vs. Automation Layer**: BPM automates the HOW; Helm governs the WHY
- **AI-Native**: Helm is built from the ground up for AI agent governance, not retrofitted
- **Fleet Learning**: Helm captures cross-enterprise benchmarks that don't exist in BPM tools
- **Executive Focus**: BPM serves process owners; Helm serves executive decision-makers

### Investor Comparison Framework

Investors will likely compare Helm to:

**Primary Comparables**:
1. **Sierra AI** - Customer service AI agents, $10B valuation, $100M ARR
2. **Celonis** - Process mining, $13B valuation, $771M revenue
3. **ServiceNow** - IT workflow platform, $132B market cap, 17x revenue
4. **Datadog** - Observability, $45B market cap, 14x revenue

**Secondary Comparables**:
1. **Pegasystems** - BPM, $10.4B market cap, 6x revenue
2. **UiPath** - RPA, $10B market cap, 6.5x revenue
3. **Dynatrace** - Observability, $12.8B market cap, 7x revenue
4. **Creatio** - No-code BPM, $1.2B valuation

### Strategic Positioning Recommendations

**1. Emphasize the Category Intersection**

Helm sits at a unique intersection that no single competitor addresses:
- BI vendors don't do process discovery or agent governance
- BPM vendors don't do executive-level decision intelligence
- ITOM vendors focus on systems, not business outcomes
- Consultants deliver projects, not continuous platforms

**2. Lead with the "AI ROI Crisis" Narrative**

- 95% of AI pilots fail (MIT)
- 61% of companies using AI see no enterprise ROI (McKinsey)
- Position Helm as the solution to the $Trillion governance gap

**3. Differentiate from "Control Plane" Vendors**

- Microsoft, GitHub, Salesforce own "Control Plane" (operational governance)
- Helm owns "Decision Intelligence" (strategic governance)
- Different problems, different buyers, complementary positioning

**4. Highlight Network Effects**

- Fleet learning creates defensible moat
- Peer benchmarks don't exist elsewhere
- Winner-take-most dynamics in category

**5. Target SMB-First for Disruption**

- 150,000 SMB companies (100-2,000 employees) completely ignored by incumbents
- Freemium model creates 10-100x more users than enterprise-focused competitors
- Classic low-end disruption playbook (Atlassian, Zoom, Figma)

### Competitive Moats Summary

| Moat | Description | Strength |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Technology | Edge-first LLM architecture | Medium-High |
| Data | Millions of observed workflows | High |
| Network Effects | Fleet learning, peer benchmarks | Very High |
| Business Model | Freemium creates massive user base | High |
| Category Position | First-mover in Decision Intelligence for Service | Medium-High |

### Key Risks to Address

1. **Category Risk**: Decision Intelligence may be absorbed into adjacent categories
2. **Platform Risk**: Large vendors (ServiceNow, Salesforce) could build competing features
3. **Data Moat Timeline**: Need sufficient user adoption before network effects compound
4. **Enterprise Sales**: Moving upmarket requires different go-to-market motion
