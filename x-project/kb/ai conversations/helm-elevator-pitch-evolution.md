### User
lets start with an elevator pitch for Helm.

### Claude
Here's a tight elevator pitch for Helm:

**30-second version:**

"Every customer service executive has blind spots. Some know their operation cold but can't see where to invest. Others are drowning in data but missing the story. Helm is the AI command center that gives you the context you're missing — showing you what's broken, what's working, and where you should focus next. Not another dashboard. Your strategic layer."

**15-second version:**

"Helm gives customer service executives the context they're missing. Most leaders have blind spots — either in execution or strategy. Helm is the AI layer that shows you both, so you can lead with confidence."

**One-liner:**

"Helm is the AI command center that shows customer service leaders what they can't see — so they can act on what matters."

Want me to tune any of these toward a specific audience (investor vs. prospect) or adjust the tone?

remind me of the top candidates we considered when last doing this.

### Claude
Found it. Here are the top candidates we explored:

**Elevator Pitch (30-second) — Favorite Version:**

"You own customer service. You've got CRM, ticketing, workforce management, analytics — tools everywhere. But nothing connects them. Nothing tells you where to focus. Helm is the AI-powered command layer that sits above it all — giving you one view of what's happening and one clear answer: what to do next."

**One-liner candidates we tested:**

- "The command layer for customer service leaders."
- "The executive layer that turns operational data into strategic clarity."
- "One view across your entire operation. One clear path forward."
- "The AI-powered layer that shows you where to focus."
- "Helm: Your executive co-pilot."
- "Helm: Strategic clarity for the people at the helm."
- "You have tools for execution. Helm gives you clarity for decisions."

**Opening hooks we liked:**

- "Your strategy runs on gut feel."
- "Every tool gives you a slice. Nothing gives you the picture."

**Key phrase you gravitated toward:**

"Executive co-pilot" — you said it "tells what it is."

Since then, you've also refined the positioning statement to:

"Helm is the AI-powered command center that gives customer service executives the context to lead with confidence."

Want to revisit any of these, or start fresh with a new angle?
