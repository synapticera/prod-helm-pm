## Executive Summary

ServiceNow's AI Control Tower demo reveals a **governance-first, compliance-driven platform** designed to become the **system of record for enterprise AI risk management**. The 5-minute demo showcases a multi-persona workflow for AI system intake, risk assessment, and lifecycle management with deep regulatory compliance focus (EU AI Act, fundamental rights assessments).

### Strategic Positioning

- **Market Play:** Multi-platform AI governance layer (not ServiceNow-exclusive)
- **Buyer Focus:** Chief AI Officers, Risk/Compliance Officers, AI Centers of Excellence
- **Value Prop:** Centralized visibility, regulatory compliance, risk mitigation
- **Differentiation:** Stakeholder orchestration + embedded GRC integration

### Key Insight for HELM

ServiceNow is building the **"governance/compliance layer"** while HELM focuses on the **"value delivery/decision intelligence layer."** These are **complementary, not competitive**—organizations will likely need both:

- **ServiceNow:** "Is our AI compliant and properly governed?"
- **HELM:** "Is our AI delivering value and ROI?"
