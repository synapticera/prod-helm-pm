**Last Updated:** 2026-01-29

**Primary Analyst:** Product Strategy Team

## Executive Summary

ServiceNow launched **AI Control Tower** at Knowledge 2025 (May 2025) as a centralized governance platform for enterprise AI management. This represents a direct move into the "AI control plane" category alongside Salesforce's Agentforce Command Center and IBM's similar offerings.

### Key Positioning

- **Market:** Enterprise AI Governance & Risk Management
- **Buyers:** C-suite executives, AI Center of Excellence, GRC teams
- **Approach:** Top-down, compliance-first, platform-centric
- **Differentiator:** Integration with ServiceNow ecosystem (CMDB, CSDM, IRM)

### Strategic Implications for HELM

ServiceNow focuses on **macro governance** (compliance, risk frameworks, strategic oversight), while HELM addresses **operational value delivery** (process optimization, executive insight, rapid ROI). These are complementary rather than directly competitive—organizations may use ServiceNow for governance frameworks while using HELM for value realization and operational intelligence.
