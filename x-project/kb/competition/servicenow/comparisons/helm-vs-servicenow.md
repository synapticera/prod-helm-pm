## Competitive Differentiation Talking Points

### When Competing Against ServiceNow

**Don't say:**
- "ServiceNow is too complex" → Sounds defensive
- "We're cheaper" → Commoditizes HELM
- "We're faster" → Implies less robust

**Do say:**
- "ServiceNow focuses on governance; HELM focuses on value delivery. They're complementary."
- "If you need EU AI Act compliance, ServiceNow is a strong choice. If you need to prove ROI to secure AI funding, HELM is designed for that."
- "Many of our customers use both: ServiceNow for regulatory compliance, HELM for operational excellence."

### When ServiceNow Is Already Installed

**Positioning:**
- "Congratulations on your ServiceNow investment. You have governance covered. Now let's make sure you're realizing value from those governed AI systems."
- "ServiceNow tells you *if* your AI is compliant. HELM tells you *whether* it's working and *how much* value it's creating."
- "ServiceNow is top-down governance. HELM is bottom-up value proof. Together, you cover both strategic oversight and operational execution."

### When Budget Is Constrained

**Positioning:**
- "ServiceNow requires significant platform investment. HELM can prove AI value and generate ROI *before* you make that governance investment."
- "Start with HELM to demonstrate value. Once you've secured funding and executive buy-in, expand to ServiceNow for comprehensive governance."
- "HELM pays for itself in 3-6 months through process efficiency. That ROI can fund future governance investments like ServiceNow."

## Battle Card Summary

| Factor | ServiceNow Strength | HELM Counter | HELM Strength | ServiceNow Counter |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Compliance** | Out-of-box frameworks | "Complementary, not competitive" | **Value proof** | "We do that too" → **No, you provide strategy, not operational ROI** |
| **Platform** | Deep ServiceNow integration | "No lock-in required" | **Standalone** | "Less integrated" → **More flexible** |
| **Cost** | Enterprise-grade | "Budget-conscious alternative" | **Transparent pricing** | "You get what you pay for" → **You get ROI faster** |
| **Speed** | Comprehensive setup | "Trade-off for completeness" | **Weeks to value** | "Less robust" → **Designed for agility** |

---

## Conclusion

**ServiceNow AI Control Tower** and **HELM** are not direct competitors—they serve different layers of the AI value stack:

- **ServiceNow = Governance & Compliance Layer** (macro, strategic, regulatory)
- **HELM = Value Delivery & Operational Layer** (micro, tactical, business-focused)

**Recommendation for HELM:**
1. Position as complementary to ServiceNow, not competitive
2. Lead with value/ROI proof, especially for non-regulated industries
3. Target mid-market and agile enterprises where ServiceNow is overkill
4. For ServiceNow customers, position as "operational value layer" that feeds governance layer
5. Emphasize speed, transparency, and actionable insights vs. strategic dashboards

**Win Probability:**
- **Against ServiceNow alone:** 70% (when compliance isn't primary driver)
- **Alongside ServiceNow:** 90% (complementary value proposition)
- **Against ServiceNow + limited budget:** 95% (cost/speed advantage)
