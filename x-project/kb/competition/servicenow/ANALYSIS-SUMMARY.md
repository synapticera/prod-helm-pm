## Key Findings Summary

### ServiceNow AI Control Tower Positioning

**What It Is:**
- Centralized governance platform for enterprise AI management
- Built on ServiceNow workflow platform (requires existing deployment)
- Launched May 2025 at Knowledge conference (GA now)

**Core Strengths:**
1. Deep regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001)
2. Integration with ServiceNow CMDB/CSDM/GRC ecosystem
3. Enterprise-scale workflow orchestration
4. Comprehensive risk management and audit trails
5. Broad partner ecosystem (Google, Microsoft, IBM, Adobe, etc.)

**Core Weaknesses:**
1. Requires ServiceNow platform (not standalone)
2. Months of implementation with professional services
3. Six-figure minimum pricing, multi-year contracts
4. Focuses on strategic governance vs. operational value
5. Manual asset registration workflows may slow agile teams

### HELM Differentiation Opportunities

**Where HELM Wins:**
- ✅ **Value Proof:** Precise ROI quantification and cost savings
- ✅ **Speed:** Weeks to value vs. months
- ✅ **Operational Focus:** Actionable insights vs. strategic dashboards
- ✅ **Platform Independence:** Standalone, no ecosystem lock-in
- ✅ **Transparent Pricing:** Subscription model vs. custom enterprise

**Where ServiceNow Wins:**
- ✅ **Regulatory Compliance:** Out-of-box frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST)
- ✅ **Risk Management:** Automated scoring, deep GRC integration
- ✅ **Asset Management:** CMDB-based with dependency mapping
- ✅ **Security:** Enterprise-grade with threat detection
- ✅ **Workflow Maturity:** Proven platform with extensive integrations

**Complementary Strategy:**
> "ServiceNow governs your AI. HELM proves it's working and generating value."

Organizations can use:
- **ServiceNow** for compliance, risk, strategic oversight
- **HELM** for operational efficiency, ROI demonstration, executive insight

## Recommended Positioning Strategy

### 1. Primary Message
**"We focus on different problems in the AI value chain"**

| ServiceNow | HELM |
|------------|------|
| "Is our AI compliant?" | "Is our AI delivering value?" |
| "Are we managing risk?" | "Are we realizing ROI?" |
| "What's our AI strategy?" | "What's working and what's not?" |

### 2. Target Scenarios

**Compete directly when:**
- Non-regulated industries (retail, tech, services)
- Mid-market companies (500-5,000 employees)
- Budget-constrained teams
- No existing ServiceNow deployment
- Value proof needed to secure funding

**Position as complementary when:**
- Large ServiceNow customers
- Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government)
- Compliance-first culture
- Both governance AND value needs identified

### 3. Sales Talking Points

**When ServiceNow comes up:**
> "ServiceNow AI Control Tower is excellent for governance and compliance—especially if you're already a ServiceNow shop. HELM complements that by focusing on operational value. ServiceNow tells you *if* your AI is compliant; HELM tells you *whether* it's working and *how much* ROI it's generating. Many customers use both."

**When budget is tight:**
> "ServiceNow requires significant platform investment—often six figures with multi-year contracts. HELM can prove AI value and generate ROI in 3-6 months, which can fund future governance investments. Start with value proof, then expand to comprehensive governance."

**When speed matters:**
> "ServiceNow takes months to implement with professional services. HELM is designed for rapid deployment—weeks, not months. If you need to demonstrate AI value to secure funding or executive buy-in, HELM's speed-to-value is critical."
