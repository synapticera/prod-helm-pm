## HELM Positioning Strategy

### Recommended Approach: "Complementary, Not Competitive"

**Core Message:**
> "ServiceNow governs your AI. Salesforce monitors your AI. HELM proves it's delivering value."

### When to Compete

**Target:** Mid-market (500-5,000 employees), non-regulated industries

**Rationale:**
- ServiceNow too expensive (six-figure minimums)
- Salesforce requires platform lock-in
- HELM provides value proof without complexity

**Messaging:** "Prove AI value without enterprise platform overhead"

---

### When to Complement

**Target:** Large enterprises with ServiceNow or Salesforce

**Rationale:**
- ServiceNow provides governance; HELM provides value measurement
- Salesforce provides operations; HELM provides ROI proof
- Organizations need both oversight AND value quantification

**Messaging:**
- **For ServiceNow customers:** "You have governance covered. Now prove ROI to stakeholders."
- **For Salesforce customers:** "You're monitoring agents. Are they delivering business value?"

---

### When to Lead

**Target:** Organizations needing to prove AI ROI to secure funding

**Rationale:**
- HELM's 3-6 month ROI timeline vs 12-24 months for ServiceNow
- Value proof enables future governance investments
- Rapid deployment doesn't require platform setup

**Messaging:** "Start with value proof, then expand to governance when funding is secured"

---

## Competitive Advantages by Category

### HELM's Strengths
1. ✅ **ROI Quantification** - Precise cost savings vs generic metrics
2. ✅ **Speed to Value** - Weeks vs months to implement
3. ✅ **Platform Independence** - No ecosystem lock-in required
4. ✅ **Business-User Friendly** - Intuitive vs admin-heavy
5. ✅ **Transparent Pricing** - Subscription vs custom enterprise

### ServiceNow's Strengths
1. ✅ **Regulatory Compliance** - EU AI Act, NIST, ISO frameworks
2. ✅ **Risk Management** - Comprehensive GRC integration
3. ✅ **Asset Management** - Full AI inventory (agents, models, datasets)
4. ✅ **Audit Trails** - Complete compliance documentation
5. ✅ **Strategic Governance** - Portfolio management

### Salesforce's Strengths
1. ✅ **Real-Time Monitoring** - Live operational dashboards
2. ✅ **Interaction Analysis** - Conversation-level drill-down
3. ✅ **Voice Integration** - Real-time call transcription
4. ✅ **MCP Support** - 30+ partner ecosystem
5. ✅ **Operational Focus** - Tactical day-to-day management

## Gap Analysis: What HELM Lacks

### Critical Gaps (Consider Addressing)
1. **Regulatory Compliance Frameworks** - ServiceNow's EU AI Act, NIST integration
   - **Recommendation:** Partner with ServiceNow vs build internally
   - **Rationale:** Too expensive to replicate, low ROI for HELM's target market

2. **Real-Time Agent Monitoring** - Salesforce's operational dashboards
   - **Recommendation:** Add process-level real-time tracking
   - **Rationale:** Complements value story with operational visibility

3. **Enterprise Integrations** - ServiceNow CMDB, Salesforce Data Cloud
   - **Recommendation:** Build connectors for both platforms
   - **Rationale:** Enables "complementary layer" positioning

### Non-Critical Gaps (Deprioritize)
1. Risk heat maps (ServiceNow feature) - Not core to value story
2. Voice transcription (Salesforce feature) - Niche use case
3. Full AI asset inventory (ServiceNow feature) - Process focus more valuable

### Battle Cards
- [ServiceNow Battle Card](./servicenow/comparisons/helm-vs-servicenow.md#battle-card-summary) - Feature comparison and talking points
- Salesforce Battle Card - Pending creation

### Talking Points by Scenario

#### Scenario 1: ServiceNow Already Deployed
> "Congratulations on establishing AI governance with ServiceNow. Now let's ensure those governed AI systems are actually delivering ROI. HELM provides the operational value layer that complements ServiceNow's governance layer—we measure and optimize what they govern and secure."

#### Scenario 2: Budget Constrained
> "ServiceNow requires six-figure investment with multi-year contracts. HELM can prove AI value and generate ROI in 3-6 months for a fraction of the cost. Start with value proof, then expand to comprehensive governance when funding is secured."

#### Scenario 3: Speed Matters
> "ServiceNow takes months to implement. HELM is designed for rapid deployment—weeks, not months. If you need to demonstrate AI ROI to secure funding or executive buy-in, HELM's speed-to-value is critical."
