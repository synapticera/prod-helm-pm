---

## Conclusion

The AI Control Plane market has **three distinct layers:**

1. **Governance Layer** (ServiceNow) - Compliance, risk, strategic oversight
2. **Operations Layer** (Salesforce) - Real-time monitoring, agent management
3. **Value Layer** (HELM) - ROI quantification, business outcome proof

**These are complementary, not competitive.** Organizations will deploy multiple solutions addressing different stakeholder needs:
- **CRO** needs ServiceNow for compliance
- **COO** needs Salesforce for operations
- **CEO/CFO** need HELM for value proof

**HELM's opportunity:** Own the value layer. ServiceNow and Salesforce customers need ROI proof. Mid-market needs value proof before investing in governance/operations platforms.

**Recommended positioning:** "Prove AI value first, then invest in governance and operations platforms."
