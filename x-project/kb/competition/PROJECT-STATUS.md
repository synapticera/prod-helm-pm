# Competitive Intelligence Project - Status & Recommendations

**Project Start:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete (ServiceNow + Salesforce)
**Total Investment:** ~50,000 words, 12 documents, 10 screenshots
**Next Review:** 2026-04-30 (quarterly refresh recommended)

---

## Executive Summary

We've completed comprehensive competitive intelligence on the two major players in the emerging "AI Control Plane" market:

1. **ServiceNow AI Control Tower** (Governance & Compliance focus)
2. **Salesforce Agentforce Command Center** (Observability & Operations focus)

**Key Finding:** These platforms are **complementary layers** in the enterprise AI stack, not direct competitors to HELM. Organizations will deploy multiple solutions addressing different stakeholder needs.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Position HELM as the **"Value Layer"** that sits alongside (not against) ServiceNow's governance layer and Salesforce's operations layer.

## Strategic Recommendations for HELM

### 1. Positioning Strategy: "Complementary Layers"

**Recommended Core Message:**
> "ServiceNow governs your AI. Salesforce monitors your AI. **HELM proves it's delivering value.**"

**Rationale:**
- ServiceNow and Salesforce are NOT direct competitors
- They address different layers of enterprise AI stack
- HELM fills the value measurement gap both platforms lack

**Implementation:**
- Train sales team on "complementary vs competitive" positioning
- Create joint value proposition documents
- Develop integration proof-of-concepts with both platforms

---

### 2. Three-Pronged Go-to-Market Strategy

#### **Prong 1: Compete Directly** (Primary Target)
**Market:** Mid-market (500-5,000 employees), non-regulated industries

**Why:**
- ServiceNow too expensive (six-figure minimums)
- Salesforce requires platform lock-in
- These companies need value proof, not governance complexity

**Messaging:**
> "Prove AI value without enterprise platform overhead"

**Win Probability:** 70-80%

---

#### **Prong 2: Position as Complementary** (Secondary Target)
**Market:** Large enterprises with ServiceNow or Salesforce

**Why:**
- ServiceNow provides governance; HELM provides value measurement
- Salesforce provides operations; HELM provides ROI proof
- Organizations need both oversight AND value quantification

**Messaging:**
- **For ServiceNow customers:** "You have governance covered. Now prove ROI to stakeholders."
- **For Salesforce customers:** "You're monitoring agents. Are they delivering business value?"

**Win Probability:** 60-70% (as add-on)

---

#### **Prong 3: Lead with Value** (Tertiary Target)
**Market:** Organizations needing to prove AI ROI to secure funding

**Why:**
- HELM's 3-6 month ROI timeline vs 12-24 months for ServiceNow
- Value proof enables future governance investments
- Rapid deployment doesn't require platform setup

**Messaging:**
> "Start with value proof, then expand to governance when funding is secured"

**Win Probability:** 80-90% (when timing is critical)

---

### 3. Product Strategy: Focus on Differentiation

**Double Down On (HELM's Strengths):**
1. ✅ **ROI Quantification** - Widen the gap vs competitors
   - Add more granular cost savings models
   - Build industry-specific value benchmarks
   - Create executive ROI dashboards

2. ✅ **Speed to Value** - Maintain deployment advantage
   - Keep implementation under 4 weeks
   - Self-service onboarding
   - Pre-built templates for common use cases

3. ✅ **Platform Independence** - Emphasize flexibility
   - Build connectors for ServiceNow and Salesforce
   - Support any AI system (not just specific platforms)
   - No ecosystem lock-in

**Address Selectively (Close Critical Gaps):**
1. ⚠️ **Real-Time Dashboards** - Add operational visibility
   - Not trying to match Salesforce's conversation-level detail
   - But add process-level real-time tracking
   - Complements value story with operational context

2. ⚠️ **Compliance Reporting** - Basic compliance support
   - Not trying to match ServiceNow's regulatory frameworks
   - But add basic compliance reporting for common standards
   - Partner with ServiceNow for deep compliance needs

**Deprioritize (Not Core to Value Story):**
1. ❌ Risk heat maps (ServiceNow's strength)
2. ❌ Voice transcription (Salesforce's niche feature)
3. ❌ Full AI asset inventory (technical vs business focus)

---

### 4. Partnership Strategy: Build the Ecosystem

**Recommended Partners:**

**ServiceNow:**
- **Opportunity:** Integrate HELM value metrics into AI Control Tower
- **Value Prop:** ServiceNow customers need ROI proof; HELM fills that gap
- **Approach:** Joint solution - Governance (ServiceNow) + Value (HELM)

**Salesforce:**
- **Opportunity:** Feed HELM ROI data into Command Center dashboards
- **Value Prop:** Salesforce customers track operations but need business value
- **Approach:** Integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**System Integrators:**
- **Targets:** Accenture, Deloitte, IBM Consulting, KPMG
- **Opportunity:** Joint delivery of governance + operations + value
- **Value Prop:** Complete AI management stack for enterprise customers

## Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Competitors Evolve Value Measurement
**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor ServiceNow's "innovation lab" metrics closely
- Track Salesforce's ROI measurement enhancements
- Accelerate HELM's value quantification roadmap
- Build switching costs through customer success

---

### Risk 2: Market Consolidates Around Platform Players
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Position as complementary (not standalone alternative)
- Build deep integrations with both platforms
- Partner early before they build internally
- Target mid-market where platforms are overkill

---

### Risk 3: Regulatory Compliance Becomes Table Stakes
**Likelihood:** High (EU AI Act enforcement 2026)
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Partner with ServiceNow for compliance layer
- Build basic compliance reporting (don't try to match depth)
- Focus on non-regulated industries (tech, retail)
- Emphasize value proof before compliance investment

---

### Risk 4: Sales Team Positions as Competitive (Not Complementary)
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Train sales team on three-pronged strategy
- Develop clear decision trees (compete vs complement)
- Incentivize complementary sales (higher ACV)
- Create "land and expand" playbooks

---

## Conclusion

We've built a **comprehensive competitive intelligence foundation** covering the two major players in the AI Control Plane market. The analysis reveals a clear opportunity for HELM to **own the "Value Layer"** while ServiceNow and Salesforce focus on governance and operations respectively.

**Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order):**
1. ✅ **Complete Salesforce visual assets** (unlock full sales enablement)
2. ✅ **Create battle cards** (immediate sales team impact)
3. ✅ **Build side-by-side deck** (enable visual storytelling)
4. ⚠️ **Research IBM** (complete Big 3 analysis)
5. ⚠️ **Develop integrations** (prove complementary positioning)

**Critical Success Factor:** Train sales team to position HELM as **complementary value layer**, not competitive alternative, for enterprise deals. Reserve competitive positioning for mid-market where platform complexity is overkill.

**Market Timing:** Act quickly. ServiceNow and Salesforce both weak on value measurement. Window of opportunity to establish HELM as category leader in value management before they build it internally.
