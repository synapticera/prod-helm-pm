## Market Positioning

### Competitive Landscape
Salesforce positions Agentforce Command Center as:
- **More operational** than ServiceNow (observability vs governance)
- **More real-time** than traditional BI tools
- **More accessible** than enterprise governance platforms
- **More integrated** than point solutions

### Analyst Perspective
> "Salesforce's Atlas reasoning engine excels at the 'front-end' nuance of customer engagement, [while] ServiceNow's AI Control Tower provides a more robust framework for multi-agent governance."
