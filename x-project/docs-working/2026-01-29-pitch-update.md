# Helm Investor Presentation - Revised Outline

## Based on Karen Bloomberg Feedback (January 27, 2026)

**Key Revision Principles:**
1. Lead with specific customer stories, not macro trends
2. Make the value proposition concrete and easy to follow
3. Focus on GTM leading indicators, not revenue milestones
4. Put the AI product (alpha) on top, services (beta) supporting
5. Clear cash runway and operating model visualization
6. Concrete Salesforce channel story

---

## 1. Opening: Customer Story (1 slide, 2 minutes)

### The Delta Dental Story

**Format**: Compelling 2-minute narrative that grounds the entire pitch

**Story Arc:**
- **Where they were**: "Delta Dental didn't know how to use AI. They had deployed agents, but results were disappointing. The team was skeptical."
- **What we did**: "We came in and showed them what they couldn't see - how decisions were actually being made, where agents were failing, and what needed to change."
- **Where they are now**: "Now our person is seen as the luminary in the firm. They're expanding Helm across the organization."
- **The pattern**: "We're going to do the same thing for other customers. And guess what? Salesforce is selling this for us."

**Key Line**: "This is what Helm does. We turn AI confusion into AI confidence."

---

## 2. The Three Things Helm Does (1 slide)

### Concrete, Channel-Friendly Positioning

**The Problem in One Sentence**: Companies deploy AI agents but can't see if they're working, can't govern them, and can't improve them.

**The Three Things Helm Does** (what a channel partner can sell):

| # | Capability | Buyer Benefit | Proof Point |
|---|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | **See What's Happening** | Executives finally understand how decisions are being made | "We showed them 47% of escalations were unnecessary" |
| 2 | **Design What Should Happen** | Clear roadmap from current state to AI-optimized future | "Reduced design-to-deploy time from 6 months to 6 weeks" |
| 3 | **Ensure It Keeps Working** | Continuous governance, monitoring, and improvement | "Caught a policy violation before it cost $2M" |

**Anchor Statement**: "Helm is the executive command center that shows service leaders what they can't see—so they can act on what matters."

---

## 3. The AI Product: Helm Platform (2 slides)

### Slide 3a: Product Overview - The Alpha

**Positioning**: This is the growth engine. This is where the money goes. This is what we're building.

**Core Product**:
- **Explore** (Free): Learn AI in customer service, benchmarks, best practices
- **Mine** (One-Time): Map current operations, establish baseline, identify gaps
- **Design** (One-Time): Create transformation roadmap, define future state
- **Manage** (Subscription): Continuous monitoring, governance, improvement

**Why It's Differentiated**:
- AI-native architecture (not retrofitted)
- Platform-independent (not locked to Salesforce, but starts there)
- Decision trace infrastructure (creates network effects)
- Natural language interface (executives can use it, not just analysts)

### Slide 3b: Product KPIs and Leading Indicators

**What We're Tracking** (these matter more than $1M ARR):

| KPI | Current | Target (12 mo) | Why It Matters |
|-----|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Active Users** | [X] | [Y] | Product engagement |
| **Journey Completion** | [X]% | [Y]% | Users finding value |
| **Organic Signups** | [X]/mo | [Y]/mo | GTM motion working |
| **Free-to-Paid Conversion** | [X]% | [Y]% | Product-market fit |
| **Expansion Rate** | [X]% | [Y]% | "Just add water" potential |

**The Story These Tell**: We're starting to understand the GTM motion. Hire salespeople → revenue follows. Just add water.

## 4. The Salesforce Channel (1 slide)

### Why Salesforce Needs Us (and Is Selling for Us)

**The Salesforce Positioning**:
- "Salesforce has all this great data, but AI is commoditizing fast"
- "They need to find ways to stay relevant"
- "They need partners who can make Agentforce actually work for customers"
- Helm is that partner: we make Agentforce deployments successful

**Channel Evidence**:
- [Number] of Salesforce AEs actively referring us
- [Number] of joint customer conversations
- [Pipeline value] from Salesforce-sourced leads
- "Salesforce is selling this for us"

**Why This Resonates With Investors**:
- Salesforce dependency is a strength, not a weakness
- 70K+ Service Cloud customers = massive installed base
- Channel leverage = capital efficient growth

---

## 5. Operating Model: Alpha + Beta (1 slide)

### How the Business Works

**The Alpha (AI Product - Growth Engine)**:
- Helm platform (Explore → Mine → Design → Manage)
- This is where the investment goes
- High-margin, scalable, network effects
- **Goal**: Build proof points, demonstrate GTM motion

**The Beta (AI Services - Cash Generator)**:
- Industry agents, apps, forward-deployed engineers
- Supports the platform business with real-world implementation
- Generates cash, maintains customer relationships
- **Goal**: Not going to zero, provides runway optionality

**Key Insight for Investors**:
- East Coast investors understand this model (services + product)
- Lead with the alpha (that's the growth story)
- Beta provides downside protection and market intelligence

---

## 6. Financial Picture: Clear and Simple (1 slide)

### Cash Runway Visualization

**The Simple Story**:

```
Current Cash:        $1.0M
This Raise:          $3.0M
Total Available:     $4.0M

Annual Burn:         ~$2.5-2.6M

Year-End Position:   ~$1.5M remaining
```

**What This Means**:
- We're not running out of money at the end of the year
- We have fuel in the tank to figure out what's next
- If things go better: we're ahead of plan
- If things go worse: we can dial up services, buy time

**The Scenario View**:

| Scenario | Revenue | Cash Position (EOY) | Next Step |
|----------|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| Optimistic | $2M+ | $2M+ | Accelerate |
| Base Case | $1-1.5M | $1.5M | Continue building |
| Conservative | $500K | $1M | Dial up services, extend |

## 7. What We're Really Targeting (1 slide)

### Leading Indicators Over Revenue Milestones

**Old Framing** (what Karen said doesn't work):
- "Get to $1M ARR" ← Not interesting for AI companies, scales too fast

**New Framing** (what Karen wants to see):

| Indicator | Why It Matters | Our Target |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Usage Metrics** | Product engagement, stickiness | [Specific targets] |
| **Journey Data** | Users completing value path | [Specific targets] |
| **Organic Growth** | GTM motion figured out | [Specific targets] |
| **Expansion Signals** | "Just add water" potential | [Specific targets] |
| **Salesforce Momentum** | Channel working | [Specific targets] |

**The Thesis**: "If these indicators show up, hiring salespeople will directly translate to revenue. We're figuring out the GTM motion."

---

## 8. Market Context (1 slide)

### The Safe Place to Invest in AI

**NOT the macro pitch** (everyone knows AI is important):

**The investor framing**:
- Models are moving incredibly fast (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Pure AI plays are getting decimated (high valuations, commoditization risk)
- "The safe place to invest" = companies making AI useful in specific domains

**Why Helm is the safe bet**:
- Domain expertise that OpenAI can't easily replicate
- Salesforce relationship provides distribution moat
- Not competing on model capability—competing on making AI work
- "Of all the people playing in this area, Salesforce is probably in a better position than many"

---

## 9. The Ask (1 slide)

### Raising $3M

**Use of Funds**:
- Engineering/Product: Drive proof points for AI product
- GTM: Build pipeline momentum, channel development
- Operations: Extend runway, maintain optionality

**What This Gets Us**:
- 12-18 months of runway
- Proof points showing GTM motion works
- Pipeline and momentum for larger raise
- Fuel in the tank for next move

**Key Milestones**:
- [Specific user/customer targets]
- [Specific channel development targets]
- [Specific product capability targets]

---

## 10. The Bones of the Story (1 slide)

### Why This Works

**The ingredients are all there**:

1. ✅ **New Layer**: Executive function for AI agents (specific, not nebulous)
2. ✅ **Get There Fast**: First-mover in category definition
3. ✅ **It's Huge**: 150K+ companies need this, $B+ opportunity
4. ✅ **Not Occupied Yet**: No one owns "Executive Agent" category
5. ✅ **We Know It**: We've lived it—we understand the problem from inside
6. ✅ **Building on What We've Got**: Existing customers, Salesforce relationship, team expertise

**Call to Action**: "The story needs to sing a bit more, but the bones are right. We're close."

## Presentation Notes

### Key Delivery Guidance (from Karen)

**DO**:
- Start with Delta Dental story (specific, 2 minutes, compelling)
- Go "particular to general" - specific stories make the opportunity feel bigger
- Show leading indicators of GTM motion, not revenue goals
- Make it easy for people to follow
- Put AI product on top
- Be specific about what Helm does (3 things a channel partner can sell)

**DON'T**:
- Lead with macro trends ("AI is the bottleneck" - everyone knows)
- Use jargon that sounds like "consultative AI"
- Say "new layer" without being specific about what it does
- Focus on $1M ARR as a milestone
- Bury the AI product under the services story

### Narrative Flow

1. **Open**: Customer story (Delta Dental) - 2 minutes
2. **Ground**: Three specific things Helm does
3. **Product**: The AI platform and its KPIs
4. **Channel**: Why Salesforce is selling for us
5. **Model**: Alpha (product) + Beta (services)
6. **Financials**: Simple cash runway picture
7. **Metrics**: What we're really targeting (leading indicators)
8. **Context**: Why this is a safe place to invest
9. **Ask**: $3M, what it gets us
10. **Close**: The bones are right, we're close

| Previous | Revised | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|

| $1M ARR milestone focus | GTM leading indicators (usage, journey, organic) | "$1M isn't interesting for AI companies" |
| Market-first approach | Customer story first, product second | "This is 1000x more interesting than the funnel" |
| Complex financial slides | Simple cash runway visualization | "When do we run out, what's the buffer" |
| Nebulous channel story | Concrete Salesforce evidence | "Make it easier for channel person to sell" |
| Mixed product/services | Clear Alpha (product) / Beta (services) separation | "Lead with the growth engine" |
