# Category Definition: Technical & Modern Transformation Management

## 20 Category Name Recommendations

### Theme 1: Emphasize Intelligence & Autonomy

1. **Business Process Intelligence (BPI)**
   - Clean evolution from BPM, emphasizes smarts over management
   - "BPI platform" sounds modern and data-driven

2. **Autonomous Process Operations (APO)**
   - Signals self-running, AI-native processes
   - "APO" sounds like a next-gen category (like APM, AIOps)

3. **Intelligent Work Orchestration (IWO)**
   - Captures humans + agents working together
   - "Orchestration" feels more dynamic than "management"

4. **Cognitive Process Automation (CPA)**
   - Emphasizes AI/learning vs. dumb RPA
   - Already some market awareness of "cognitive" = smart automation

### Theme 2: Emphasize Continuous/Living Systems

5. **Continuous Process Optimization (CPO)**
   - Signals ongoing improvement, not one-time projects
   - Parallel to "Continuous Integration/Deployment" in DevOps

6. **Dynamic Work Intelligence (DWI)**
   - "Dynamic" = always adapting, never static
   - Moves away from "process" entirely (fresher language)

7. **Adaptive Business Operations (ABO)**
   - Emphasizes systems that learn and adjust
   - "Operations" feels more modern than "processes"

8. **Living Process Intelligence (LPI)**
   - "Living" = evolving, not frozen in time
   - Captures the digital twin concept

### Theme 3: Emphasize Agent/AI Native

9. **Agent-Centric Operations (ACO)**
   - Explicitly positions agents as first-class citizens
   - Clear differentiation from traditional process tools

10. **Work Intelligence & Agent Assurance (WIAA)**
    - Two-part category name (like "Sales & Marketing Automation")
    - Captures both sides: understanding work + ensuring agents perform

11. **Agentic Process Intelligence (API)**
    - "Agentic" = emerging term for agent-driven systems
    - Signals AI-first approach (acronym conflict noted)

12. **Agent Performance & Process Intelligence (APPI)**
    - Explicit pairing of the two core capabilities
    - Clear what you do differently

### Theme 4: Emphasize ROI/Outcomes

13. **Process Economics & Optimization (PEO)**
    - Emphasizes business value over technology
    - "Economics" = ROI, cost savings, value capture

14. **Work Yield Optimization (WYO)**
    - "Yield" = ROI, output, efficiency (like "yield management")
    - Forward-looking, outcome-oriented

15. **Operational Intelligence & Assurance (OIA)**
    - Covers both discovery (intelligence) and ongoing monitoring (assurance)
    - "Assurance" is a differentiator vs. passive analytics

16. **Business Process Economics (BPE)**
    - Keeps "Business Process" but pivots to value/ROI
    - Emphasizes financial outcomes

### Theme 5: New Language (Move Away from "Process" Entirely)

17. **Work Intelligence Platform (WIP)**
    - Simple, clean, modern
    - "Work" is broader and more human than "process"

18. **Enterprise Work Orchestration (EWO)**
    - "Work" instead of "process"
    - "Orchestration" implies coordination of humans + agents

19. **Operational Intelligence Platform (OIP)**
    - "Operational" = running the business day-to-day
    - Broader than just "processes"

20. **Intelligent Operations Platform (IOP)**
    - Clean, simple, AI-native
    - "Operations" feels more modern than "process management"

## Initial Top 3 Recommendations

### #1: Agent-Centric Operations (ACO)
- **Why:** Explicitly positions agents as the core focus, which is your differentiation
- **Category pitch:** "ACO platforms ensure AI agents deliver measurable business value through integrated process, task, org, and agent intelligence"
- **Strength:** Impossible for traditional process mining vendors to claim this

### #2: Continuous Process Optimization (CPO)
- **Why:** Emphasizes ongoing/living nature vs. one-time transformation projects
- **Category pitch:** "CPO platforms continuously discover, optimize, and assure business processes and AI agents deliver ROI"
- **Strength:** Familiar enough to understand, fresh enough to signal innovation

### #3: Work Intelligence Platform (WIP)
- **Why:** Moves away from "process" entirely, emphasizes intelligence/data
- **Category pitch:** "WIP platforms provide comprehensive intelligence across work, systems, and agents to drive continuous optimization and measurable ROI"
- **Strength:** Broadest positioning, room to grow beyond process-centric view

---

## What to Avoid
- Anything with "Management" (BPM baggage)
- Anything with "Transformation" (limits positioning)
- Anything with "Mining" (too narrow, vendor-specific)
- Overly technical acronyms that don't roll off the tongue

---

## Critical Analysis of Top 3

### #1 Agent-Centric Operations (ACO)
**Strengths:**
- Best differentiation — competitors can't credibly claim this yet
- Future-proof if agents become the default operating model

**Risks:**
- Assumes market is ready to organize around "agents" — most enterprises still think in "processes" or "automation"
- Might telegraph that you're a narrow play (agents only) vs. a platform
- **Verdict:** Strongest differentiation, weakest for immediate market clarity

### #2 Continuous Process Optimization (CPO)
**Strengths:**
- Familiar enough to understand immediately
- "Continuous" signals the ongoing/living aspect

**Risks:**
- Still carries "process" baggage (feels like incremental improvement, not transformation)
- "Optimization" is inherently reactive — you're chasing efficiency on existing work
- **Acronym collision** — CPO already used for Chief Product Officer, Chief People Officer
- **Verdict:** Safe but not differentiated; plays it too close to BPM

### #3 Work Intelligence Platform (WIP)
**Strengths:**
- Broadest positioning, room to grow
- "Intelligence" signals AI-native

**Risks:**
- **WIP is a terrible acronym** — "Work In Progress" already owns this in tech/manufacturing
- Too vague — "work intelligence" could mean anything (BI tool? Analytics? Agents?)
- "Platform" doesn't differentiate (everyone says platform)
- **Verdict:** Good direction, bad execution

---

## Key Decision Framework

Before choosing, answer these fundamental questions:

1. **Is "agents" your core differentiator or just your current implementation?**
   - If core → ACO
   - If just implementation → back away from agent-centric naming

2. **What's the primary outcome you're selling?**
   - "We show you what's broken" → Intelligence
   - "We continuously improve processes" → CPO/Optimization
   - "We make work autonomous" → ACO/Agent-Centric
   - "We prove ROI from every change" → Economics/Assurance

3. **Can you own "Operational Intelligence" in the market?**
   - This is a potential gap in the options

## Follow-Up Discussion: "Work" vs "Process"

### Consideration: Work Optimization Platform vs Work Evolution Platform

**The Tension Identified:**
- "Work" is good (modern, avoids BPM baggage)
- "Work" is risky (without operational grounding, could get confused with HR/people ops)
- "Evolution" is good (forward-looking, continuous, adaptive vs. reactive "optimization")
- "Evolution" is risky (too abstract without context)

### The Risk
Without clear context, "work" could be confused with HR, talent management, or employee experience tools. "Evolution" needs anchoring or it sounds too abstract.

**Solution:** Use "work" + "evolution" but add operational grounding.

---

## Final Recommendation: Operational Work Evolution (OWE)

### Why This Works
- **"Operational"** = anchors you in business operations/processes, not HR/people management
- **"Work"** = modern language, avoids BPM baggage
- **"Evolution"** = forward-looking, signals continuous adaptation vs. one-time optimization
- **Acronym** = OWE (clean, pronounceable)

### Category Pitch
> "OWE platforms continuously discover, evolve, and assure how business work gets done — combining process intelligence, agent orchestration, and operational validation"

This pitch is key — it signals "how work *gets done*" (operations), not "how people develop" (HR).

---

## Alternative: Continuous Work Evolution (CWE)

If you prefer the "Continuous" pattern (familiar from CI/CD):
- Signals ongoing, never-static
- Still avoids the "process" baggage
- "Continuous Work Evolution" has a nice rhythm
- CWE is clean

## Comparison Table: Final Contenders

| | Work Optimization | Work Evolution | Operational Work Evolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Avoids BPM baggage** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Avoids HR confusion** | ⚠️ Risky | ⚠️ Risky | ✅ Yes |
| **Signals ongoing/adaptive** | Partial | ✅ Strong | ✅ Strong |
| **Stays in ops space** | ⚠️ Unclear | ⚠️ Unclear | ✅ Clear |
| **Differentiates vs. others** | Weak | Moderate | Strong |

## Recommendation Summary

**Recommended:** Operational Work Evolution (OWE) or Continuous Work Evolution (CWE)

"Operational Work Evolution" keeps the "work" modern language but grounds it so nobody confuses it with an HR platform. The operational qualifier is the differentiator.
