## EVOLVE Per-Agent Value Heuristic

### **Simple Revenue Model: $350-400 per Service Rep per Month**

To make opportunity sizing straightforward, EVOLVE uses a **per-service-agent** revenue model:

**Core Heuristic:**
* **$350-400 per customer service agent per month**
* **$4,200-4,800 per agent per year**

This simple multiplier allows instant opportunity calculation for any Salesforce Service Cloud customer:

| Team Size | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue | Typical Company Size |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **5 agents** | $1,750-2,000 | $21,000-24,000 | 50-100 employees |
| **10 agents** | $3,500-4,000 | $42,000-48,000 | 100-250 employees |
| **15 agents** | $5,250-6,000 | $63,000-72,000 | 250-500 employees |
| **25 agents** | $8,750-10,000 | $105,000-120,000 | 500-1,000 employees |
| **50 agents** | $17,500-20,000 | $210,000-240,000 | 1,000-2,500 employees |

### **Value Creation Per Agent (ROI Justification)**

**Customer Service Agent Economics:**
* Average fully-loaded cost per agent: **$65,000/year** ($5,417/month)
* EVOLVE automation potential: **40-50% of agent workload**
* Value created per agent: **$26,000-32,500/year**
* EVOLVE charge per agent: **$4,200-4,800/year**
* **EVOLVE capture rate: 13-18% of value created**

**Customer ROI:**
* Investment: $4,500/agent/year (midpoint)
* Savings: $29,000/agent/year (midpoint of 40-50% automation)
* **Net benefit: $24,500 per agent per year**
* **ROI: 544% per agent**

**For a typical 10-agent customer service team:**
* Annual EVOLVE cost: $45,000
* Annual labor savings: $290,000 (45% automation of $645K total cost)
* **Net annual benefit: $245,000**
* **Payback period: 1.9 months**

### **Why This Model Works**

1. **Simple to calculate**: Agents × $375/month = Monthly EVOLVE revenue
2. **Scales linearly**: Works for 5-agent SMBs and 500-agent enterprises
3. **Easy to qualify**: "How many service agents?" → Instant ARR estimate
4. **Justifiable value**: 13-18% of labor savings = strong ROI for customer
5. **Salesforce-aligned**: Similar to Salesforce's per-user pricing model

### **Opportunity Sizing by Company Size**

Using this heuristic with typical service team sizes:

| Company Size | Employee Count | Avg Service Team | EVOLVE Annual Revenue | # of Companies (Salesforce) | Market Opportunity |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Small SMB** | 20-49 | 3-5 agents | $13,500-21,000 | 43,500 | $657M-913M |
| **Medium SMB** | 50-99 | 5-8 agents | $21,000-34,000 | 22,500 | $473M-765M |
| **Lower Mid-Market** | 100-249 | 10-15 agents | $42,000-63,000 | 22,500 | $945M-1,418M |
| **Mid-Market** | 250-999 | 15-40 agents | $63,000-168,000 | 15,000 | $945M-2,520M |
| **Enterprise** | 1,000+ | 50-200 agents | $210,000-840,000 | 16,500 | $3,465M-13,860M |
| **Total** | - | - | - | **120,000** | **$6.5B-19.5B** |

*Note: Totals exclude ~30,000 micro companies (<20 employees) unlikely to have formal service teams*

**Key Insight**: Even capturing 5% of the SMB segment (44,000-66,000 companies with 5-8 agents) represents **$657M-1,678M in annual revenue potential**.

* **Adoption**: 100% of Salesforce clients' sales departments use Sales Cloud (per research)

### **3.2 Sales Cloud + Sales Ops Automation Opportunity**

While EVOLVE's primary focus is Service Cloud automation (customer service reps), there's substantial opportunity in **sales operations automation** for Sales Cloud customers.

**Sales Operations Team Sizing:**

| Company Size | Sales Team | Sales Ops Team | EVOLVE Revenue per Sales Ops Agent |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| SMB (50-99 employees) | 10-15 reps | 1-2 sales ops | $4,200-8,400/year |
| Lower Mid-Market (100-249) | 20-40 reps | 2-3 sales ops | $8,400-12,600/year |
| Mid-Market (250-999) | 50-150 reps | 5-10 sales ops | $21,000-42,000/year |
| Enterprise (1,000+) | 200-500 reps | 15-40 sales ops | $63,000-168,000/year |

**Key Difference from Service Cloud:**

## 7. Simplified Opportunity Calculator

### **Quick Opportunity Sizing Formula**

For any Salesforce Service Cloud prospect, use this simple formula:

**EVOLVE Annual Revenue = Number of Service Agents × $4,500**

**Examples:**

| Company Profile | Service Agents | Annual EVOLVE Revenue | Monthly MRR |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Small SaaS company (75 employees) | 4 agents | $18,000 | $1,500 |
| Consulting firm (150 employees) | 10 agents | $45,000 | $3,750 |
| Regional bank (350 employees) | 18 agents | $81,000 | $6,750 |
| Mid-sized retailer (800 employees) | 35 agents | $157,500 | $13,125 |
| Large enterprise (2,000 employees) | 80 agents | $360,000 | $30,000 |

### **Pipeline Qualification Questions**

1. **"How many customer service agents do you have?"**
   * Answer → Multiply by $4,500 = Annual ARR potential

2. **"Are you using Salesforce Service Cloud?"**
   * Yes → Qualified prospect
   * No → Disqualify (EVOLVE is Salesforce-native)

3. **"What Salesforce tier are you on?"**
   * Starter/Professional/Enterprise → Qualified
   * Unlimited/Einstein 1 → May require enterprise sales motion

4. **"What's your team's average fully-loaded cost per agent?"**
   * $65,000 → Standard value proposition (ROI = 544%)
   * Higher → Even stronger ROI case
   * Lower → May be offshore/outsourced, different buying motion

### **Sales Team Compensation Model**

Using the per-agent model makes quota setting straightforward:

**Sales Rep Quota:**
* Target: 20 deals per year
* Average deal size: 10 agents × $4,500 = $45,000 ARR
* **Annual quota: $900,000 ARR**

**Commission structure:**
* Base: $80,000
* Variable: $80,000 (at 100% quota attainment)
* Commission rate: ~9% of ARR ($80K / $900K)
* **OTE: $160,000**

**Sales productivity metrics:**
* Deals per month: 1.67
* Average agents per deal: 10
* Revenue per agent sold: $4,500
* **Simple tracking: "How many agents did we land this month?"**

* Average 14 agents per customer
* **$212M ARR (Year 5)**
* 200-400 enterprise customers contributing $80M-120M

### **8.3 Revenue Model Summary**

**Pricing Philosophy:**

* **Per-agent value-based**: $350-400 per service agent per month
* **Scales linearly**: Easy to calculate, easy to justify
* **Salesforce-aligned**: Similar to Salesforce's per-user pricing model
* **ROI-justified**: 13-18% of labor savings created = 544% customer ROI

**Revenue Expansion Levers:**

1. **Agent expansion**: Customer hires more service agents = automatic revenue growth
2. **Efficiency improvement**: More workflows automated = higher value capture potential
3. **Cross-cloud expansion**: Add sales ops automation = $4,200-8,400 per sales ops person
4. **Feature upsell**: Basic workflows → Advanced AI agents → Custom integrations
5. **Multi-org**: Customers with multiple Salesforce instances (subsidiaries, brands)

**LTV:CAC Economics:**

* **CAC (SMB)**: $200-500 (AppExchange + content marketing)
* **CAC (Mid-market)**: $1,500-3,000 (inside sales)
* **CAC (Enterprise)**: $5,000-15,000 (field sales)
* **LTV (SMB)**: $135K-180K (3-year retention, 10 agents avg, $4,500/agent/year)
* **LTV (Mid-market)**: $454K-605K (4-year retention, 25 agents avg)
* **LTV (Enterprise)**: $2.5M-4.2M (5-year retention, 120 agents avg)
* **LTV:CAC ratios**: 270:1 (SMB), 150:1 (mid-market), 200:1 (enterprise)

These economics are exceptional because AppExchange dramatically lowers acquisition costs while Salesforce lock-in ensures high retention.
