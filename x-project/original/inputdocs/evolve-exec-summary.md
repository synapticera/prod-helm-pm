# EVOLVE: Executive Summary

## Investment Opportunity: Democratizing Business Process Transformation

**Seeking:** $2-3M Seed Extension  
**Valuation:** [To be discussed]  
**Use of Funds:** 18-month runway to Series A ($6M+ ARR)

---

## The Problem: A $127B Market Stuck in the Past

Companies face a transformation crisis. Traditional process mining vendors like Celonis ($13B valuation) and UiPath ($12B valuation) sell expensive enterprise-only technology at $100K-500K per deployment, targeting only 8,000 large enterprises while ignoring 150,000 SMB companies that desperately need transformation but can't afford legacy solutions.

**The triple failure of current approaches:**

1. **Discovery without execution** - Process mining identifies problems but provides no path to transformation
2. **Enterprise-only economics** - $100K+ price tags exclude the vast SMB market entirely  
3. **Siloed intelligence** - Each company starts from scratch with no peer benchmarking or aggregate learning

Business leaders are flying blind, asking questions no vendor can answer: "How do my peers handle this process?" "Am I overstaffed compared to similar companies?" "Where should I focus for maximum ROI?"

## The Solution: The Tesla of Business Transformation

**EVOLVE is the first end-to-end platform that discovers how your business actually works, designs optimal transformation paths, deploys AI agents autonomously, and continuously improves performance.**

Just as Tesla democratized self-driving with commodity cameras instead of expensive LIDAR, EVOLVE uses commodity LLMs and edge AI to make enterprise-grade process intelligence accessible to businesses of all sizes.

### Our Four-Phase Transformation Engine

**1. MINE (FREE)** - Edge-first workflow discovery with local processing, zero security concerns, instant value

**2. DESIGN** - AI-powered transformation roadmaps informed by aggregate patterns across thousands of companies

**3. DELIVER** - Autonomous agent authoring and deployment with shadow mode validation

**4. MANAGE** - Continuous improvement with real-time peer benchmarking and performance monitoring

### The Disruptive Innovation: Fleet Learning

Like Tesla's millions of vehicles making autopilot smarter every day, EVOLVE's user base creates compounding intelligence advantages:

- Every workflow captured (anonymously) improves recommendations for everyone
- Edge processing preserves privacy while contributing to aggregate intelligence  
- More users → better benchmarks → smarter recommendations → better outcomes → more users
- **The peer comparison data we're building doesn't exist anywhere else**

## Why We Win: SMB-First Low-End Disruption

**We're playing a different game than legacy vendors:**

| Dimension | Legacy Vendors | EVOLVE |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Product** | Mining technology (expensive) | Mining is free, monetize transformation |
| **Market** | Enterprise-only (8,000 cos.) | SMB-first (150,000 cos.), then upmarket |
| **Pricing** | $100K-500K deals | Freemium → $500-50K/month |
| **Distribution** | Enterprise field sales | Product-led growth, viral adoption |
| **Intelligence** | Siloed per customer | Aggregate learning across users |
| **Economics** | High CAC, slow growth | Near-zero CAC, rapid scaling |
| **Moat** | Technology (commoditizing) | Network effects (compounding) |

**Classic disruption playbook:**
1. Start where incumbents can't compete (SMB economics don't work for them)
2. Build massive user base with freemium model
3. Create unassailable data moat through aggregate intelligence
4. Move upmarket with overwhelming competitive advantages

**Comparable success stories:** Atlassian ($50B, SMB to enterprise), Zoom ($20B, freemium viral), Figma ($20B acquisition, network effects)

**Viral Mechanics:**
- Every workflow captured improves benchmarks for everyone
- SMB leaders share peer comparison insights with colleagues
- "How do you have this data?" conversations drive adoption
- Free value creates organic advocacy

**Year 1 Target:** 50,000 free users, 500-1,000 paying SMB customers, $1-2M ARR

### Phase 2: Mid-Market Expansion (Year 2)

**Conversion Trigger:** "If it works for smaller companies, why not us?"

**Value Evolution:**
- SMB: "See how you compare to peers, reduce costs 30%"
- Mid-Market: "Enterprise-grade transformation at fraction of cost"
- Proof: "5,000+ SMBs transformed, $100M in proven labor savings"

**Year 2 Target:** 200,000 free users, 2,500-4,000 paying customers, $5-10M ARR

### Phase 3: Enterprise Adoption (Year 3+)

**The Inevitable Pull:**
- Enterprise sees competitors transforming faster with EVOLVE
- Board demands: "Why are smaller companies outperforming us?"

### Why Competitors Can't Catch Up

**Celonis, UiPath, SAP Signavio:**
- Require $100K-500K average deal size to sustain business
- Enterprise sales org can't economically serve SMB
- Siloed data means no cross-company learning
- **Can't pivot to freemium without destroying existing revenue**

**Task Mining Vendors (Soroco, Kryon):**
- Expensive specialized sensors limit adoption
- Cloud-based architecture raises security barriers
- No agent deployment capabilities
- **Can't change architectural foundation**

**Agent Platforms (LangChain, CrewAI, Salesforce):**
- Assume you know what to build
- No process discovery or mining capabilities
- **Starting from wrong end of the problem**

## The Opportunity

**We're not disrupting process mining. We're democratizing business transformation and creating a new category: peer-powered process intelligence.**

Just as Tesla built a fleet that made every car smarter, and Waze built a network that made every driver smarter, we're building a network that makes every business transformation more successful.

Every company—from 100-employee SMBs to 10,000-employee enterprises—will need to transform continuously. We're building the platform that makes that possible, starting where the incumbents can't follow, and capturing the peer intelligence that doesn't exist anywhere else.

**The question isn't whether this market will exist. It's who will own it.**
