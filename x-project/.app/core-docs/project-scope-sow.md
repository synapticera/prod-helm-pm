## I. Project Overview

### A. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to validate and launch a self-service staffing platform connecting summer camps with high-quality job seekers, leveraging Carney Sandoe's 15,000+ candidate database and its long standing reputation in the market as competitive differentiators. The platform will test four core market theses:

- **Market Pain Validation** - Confirm that camp leaders are unhappy with existing staffing options and willing to pay for a better solution

- **Database Advantage** - Prove that CSA's candidate pool provides superior quality that leads to better conversion rates than competitors

- **Platform Viability** - Validate technical feasibility for a compelling self-service experience

- **Brand Leverage** - Demonstrate that CSA relationships and reputation accelerate trust and adoption in the summer camp market

The project will deliver a functioning, target-audience placement solution that enables real-world market engagement with design partners and early candidates.
