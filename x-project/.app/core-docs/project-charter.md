# Project Charter: CSA Summer Camp Staffing Platform



## Vision

Validate and launch a self-service platform connecting summer camps with high-quality job seekers, leveraging Carney Sandoe's 15,000+ vetted candidate database as a competitive differentiator.

---

## Core Thesis

Test the market thesis with the most focused experiment possible:

| Thesis | Validation Question |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Market Pain** | Camp leaders are unhappy with existing options and willing to act—not just complain |
| **Database Advantage** | CSA's candidate pool provides superior quality that leads to better conversion rates |
| **Platform Viability** | CSA can rapidly deliver a compelling self-service experience |
| **Brand Leverage** | CSA relationships and reputation accelerate trust and adoption |

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Conversion validation** - Candidates respond and get hired at reasonable rates (target: Feb/March 2025)
2. **Employer willingness** - Design partners actively engage and would pay for the service
3. **Candidate engagement** - Filtered candidates respond to targeted outreach
4. **Platform confidence** - Technical feasibility validated for self-service model

---

## Approach: Design Partner Model

### Employer Side (3 Partners)
| Partner | Location | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Carly Rappaport | Camp Cohut, Maine | Identified |
| Robin Walker | North Carolina | Identified |
| TBD | New York | To confirm |

**Partner engagement includes:**
- Website job listings
- Searchable database access
- Direct feedback loop on experience

### Job Seeker Side
- Resume submission
- 7-10 qualifying questions (3 new, rest from existing CSA data)
- Key filters: geographic preference, camp type (day/overnight), position type, compensation expectations

**Feedback mechanism:** Seeker ambassadors/advisors for direct input

---

## Differentiation Vectors

1. **Geography coverage** - Precise matching on location preferences
2. **Camp type** - Day vs overnight filtering
3. **Compensation alignment** - Realistic expectation setting
4. **Mission fit** - Program type and culture matching
5. **Specialties** - Role-specific filtering (counselor, waterfront, nurse, etc.)
6. **Candidate quality** - Vetted education backgrounds (NESCAC, independent schools)

---

## Branding Approach

- **Standalone brand** with CSA affiliation ("powered by Carney Sando")
- Demonstrates camp-specific expertise
- Avoids cannibalization of existing school relationships
- Creates template for future vertical expansion

---

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Pilot launch | 30-45 days from kickoff |
| First placements | February/March 2025 |
| ACA Conference (San Diego) | February 2025 |

---

## Out of Scope (This Phase)

- Mass outreach to full 15,000 candidate database
- Final pricing/paywall implementation
- Multi-vertical expansion
- Full production platform
