- **AI-Powered Understanding:** CV models trained to recognize all screen controls (checkboxes, drop-downs, data fields, etc.)
- **Natural Language Processing:** Transcribed and interpreted user actions
- **Real-Time Intelligence:** Created detailed blueprints of digital processes across all applications and departments

### Differentiation from Traditional Process Mining

**Traditional Process Mining:**
- Relies on system logs and event data
- Limited to systems that generate logs
- Misses manual steps and workarounds
- Retrospective analysis

**FortressIQ's Task Mining:**
- Computer vision observes actual user behavior
- Captures work across any application
- Identifies manual processes and shadow IT
- Real-time process discovery
- Ground truth understanding of "what actually happens"

## Lessons for the Market

### What FortressIQ Proved

1. **Computer Vision Works for Process Mining**
   - Desktop observation provides ground truth that logs cannot
   - Real-time visibility into actual work is valuable
   - Manual and digital processes can be captured together

2. **Task Mining ≠ Process Mining**
   - Task mining (what people do) complements process mining (what systems do)
   - Both approaches needed for complete picture
   - Integration is more valuable than either alone

3. **RPA Vendors Need Discovery**
   - Process discovery became table stakes for RPA platforms
   - Acquisition was cheaper/faster than building in-house
   - Discovery + Automation = complete value chain

4. **Privacy & Governance Are Critical**
   - Desktop monitoring requires careful employee communication
   - Data governance policies must be robust
   - Transparency builds trust and adoption

### Market Evolution Post-Acquisition

**Consolidation Trend:**
- Automation Anywhere acquired FortressIQ (Dec 2021)
- Microsoft acquired Minit (March 2022)
- SAP acquired Signavio (Jan 2021)
- IBM acquired MyInvenio (Oct 2022)

**Category Convergence:**
- Process Mining + Task Mining + RPA = Hyperautomation
- Standalone process mining vendors face pressure
- Platform consolidation favors large vendors
