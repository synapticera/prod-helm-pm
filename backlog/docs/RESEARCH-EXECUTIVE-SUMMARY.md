## The Core Problem Helm Solves

### The Adoption Paradox

**The Problem:**

- 88% of enterprises use AI
- But only 6% see meaningful business impact (5%+ EBIT)
- 90% of promising use cases stuck in pilot mode
- $1T+ spent on AI with minimal returns

**Why This Happens:**

1. AI systems don't learn or improve over time (stateless)
2. Governance concerns prevent production deployment
3. Workflow redesign requires expertise organizations don't have
4. Integration with business systems fails
5. No clear path from pilot to production

### Three Specific Opportunities

**1. The Pilot Purgatory Problem (90% of cases)**

- Organizations have pilots that work but can't move to production
- Barriers: integration, governance, organizational alignment
- **Helm's Solution**: Production-ready framework with built-in governance

**2. The Learning Gap (MIT Research)**

- Current AI agents are stateless; forget everything after each interaction
- Don't accumulate knowledge or improve from feedback
- Can't adapt to organizational context
- **Helm's Solution**: Persistent memory architecture enabling true learning

**3. The Governance Gap (Regulatory Pressure)**

- Regulators (EU AI Act) now require audit trails and explainability
- Governance budgets exploding in 2026
- Non-compliance carries 7% revenue penalties
- **Helm's Solution**: Governance-first design with observability built in

## The Urgency Window: Why 2026 is Critical

### Market Timing Signals

| Phase               | 2024        | 2025           | 2026           | 2027+         |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| **Activity**        | Pilots      | Scaling        | Production     | Optimization  |
| **Spend Focus**     | Experiments | Tech           | Governance     | ROI           |
| **Market Maturity** | Exploring   | Testing        | Transitioning  | Consolidating |
| **Opportunity**     | Research    | Platform Build | Market Capture | Maintenance   |

**Why 2026 is the Inflection Point:**

- Organizations scaling past pilots (23% today → 40%+ in 2026)
- Governance requirements become mandatory (EU AI Act Aug 2026)
- First-mover advantage in production-ready solutions
- Organizations desperate for working solutions

## Customer Service & Operations: Primary TAM

### Market Size & Growth

| Segment               | TAM Size       | Growth Rate       | Note                        |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| **BPO AI**            | $49.6B (2033)  | 34.3% CAGR        | Largest submarket           |
| **Contact Center**    | Largest in BPO | 350% YoY searches | Explosive demand            |
| **Customer Service**  | Significant    | 4x failure rate   | High pain, high opportunity |
| **Global BPO Market** | $525B base     | N/A               | Context for TAM             |

### Key Metrics Showing Opportunity

**Current State:**

- Only 25% of call centers successfully integrated AI
- 68% of conversations resolved by AI (without human)
- Satisfaction near parity with humans (4.3 vs 4.4)
- Cost: $0.20/interaction (AI) vs $5.50 (human)

**Why Failure Happens:**

- 19% of customers see no benefit (4x failure vs other AI)
- 39% of bots pulled/reworked in 2024
- No feedback loops or learning systems
- Integration fails; agents can't access data

**Success Metrics (When It Works):**

- 31% reduction in average handling time
- 22% improvement in first-call resolution
- 58% reduction in total support costs
- 300-1200% annual ROI
- Break-even in 3-6 months

---

## Financial Impact: The Numbers That Matter

### ROI Reality Check

**High Performers (Top 6%):**

- Achieve 5%+ of EBIT from AI
- Report transformative business impact
- Made workflow redesign investments
- Scaling across enterprise
- **These will dominate market in 2026-2027**

**Average Performers (60%):**

- See less than 5% EBIT impact
- Stuck in pilots or early scaling
- Minimal organizational transformation
- Struggling to show ROI

**AI Agents Specifically (When Deployed):**

- **Break-even:** 3-6 months
- **Annual ROI:** 300-1200% range
- **Average:** $3.50 return per $1 invested
- **Top performers:** 8x return
- **Cost savings:** 58% reduction in operations costs

---

## The Workflow Redesign Secret Sauce

### Why High Performers Win

**McKinsey Finding:**
High performers (6% seeing 5%+ EBIT) are 3x more likely to redesign workflows.

**What They Do Differently:**

1. Don't add AI to existing work
2. **Redesign workflows completely**
3. Break processes into discrete tasks
4. Determine human vs AI execution for each task
5. Re-architect decision points and ownership
6. Reintegrate with business systems

**Impact of Redesign:**

- 10-25% EBITDA gains observed
- Faster time-to-value than incremental approach
- More sustainable competitive advantage
- Gets organizations out of pilot purgatory

**Helm's Role:**

- Provide methodology for workflow redesign
- Templates and frameworks for transformation
- Assessment tools to identify high-value opportunities
- Coaching for organizational alignment

## Governance: From Burden to Advantage

### The Regulatory Reality

**EU AI Act Timeline:**
| Deadline | Requirement | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Aug 2025 | GPAI transparency rules | ACTIVE |
| Aug 2026 | High-risk AI compliance | **CRITICAL** |
| Aug 2027 | Legacy system compliance | Future |

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**

- Up to EUR 35 million OR 7% global revenue (whichever is higher)
- Applies to high-risk AI systems
- Organizations not prepared will face significant exposure

### Why Governance is Now an Asset

**Market Trends:**

- 2026 will be "governance year" (shifting from pilot spending)
- Organizations desperate for governance frameworks
- Governance maturity becoming competitive differentiator
- First-mover advantage in governance-ready platforms

**Required Capabilities:**

- Explainability: Clear explanations of AI decisions
- Audit trails: Complete decision history and reasoning
- Compliance: Regulatory requirement management
- Observability: Real-time monitoring of agent behavior
- Risk management: Continuous monitoring and adaptation

**Helm's Advantage:**

- Build governance as feature, not add-on
- Make compliance a competitive advantage
- Enable faster production deployment (vs. manual governance)
- Support regulatory audits and documentation
