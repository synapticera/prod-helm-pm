## Executive Summary

### Key Findings at a Glance

- **Adoption Paradox**: 88% of enterprises use AI regularly, but only 6% see meaningful business impact (5%+ EBIT)
- **Agentic AI Growth**: 23% actively scaling agents; 39% experimenting; 40% of enterprise apps projected to include agents by 2026
- **Market Explosion**: AI agents market growing from $7.63B (2025) to $52.62B (2030) at 46.3% CAGR
- **Workflow Redesign Critical**: Companies redesigning workflows see 10-25% EBITDA gains; workflow redesign is top differentiator
- **High Failure Rate**: 95% of AI projects see no measurable ROI; customer service AI fails 4x more than other AI uses
- **Success Window**: Break-even in 3-6 months; 300-1200% ROI within first year for agents that work
- **Governance Gap**: By 2026, AI governance spending will exceed pilot spending; compliance and transparency are now table stakes
- **Regulatory Pressure**: EU AI Act full compliance required August 2026; 7% revenue penalties for violations

### Strategic Positioning for Helm

The research reveals three critical themes that position Helm for success:

1. **The Pilot Purgatory Problem**: Most organizations (90%) cannot move AI from pilot to production
2. **The Memory Gap**: Current AI systems don't learn, retain knowledge, or improve over time
3. **The Governance Imperative**: Enterprise customers demand explainability, audit trails, and compliance frameworks

Helm's core value prop addresses all three.

- Fewer than 10% reach production scale
- Major barriers:
  - Technical debt in legacy systems
  - Organizational silos preventing integration
  - Lack of leadership alignment on transformation
  - Insufficient workflow redesign

**The "Learning Gap"** (MIT):

- Most corporate AI systems don't retain feedback

**Integration Challenges:**

- Data quality and readiness (43% cite as barrier)
- Technical maturity gaps (43% cite as barrier)
- Skills shortage (35% cite as barrier)
- System integration complexity (APIs, unified records, event-driven infrastructure)

### Success Factors for Agent Deployment

**McKinsey's Key Success Factor**: Workflow Redesign

- High performers nearly 3x more likely to fundamentally redesign workflows
- Re-architecture of workflows, decision points, task ownership
- Breaking work down into tasks and determining human vs. AI execution
- Integration into real business processes
- Narrow, high-value use cases first

**Critical Implementation Practices:**

1. Start with high-value, repeatable tasks
2. Ensure tight integration with business systems
3. Implement feedback loops and continuous improvement mechanisms

Workflow redesign is the strongest driver of enterprise-level impact, differentiating AI high performers from the rest.

**What Distinguishes High Performers (6% achieving 5%+ EBIT impact):**

1. **Transformative innovation mindset**: Using AI to fundamentally reimagine work
2. **Workflow redesign**: Breaking workflows into tasks, determining human vs. AI execution
3. **Faster scaling**: Moving from pilots to enterprise-wide deployment
4. **Best practice implementation**: Adopting proven transformation approaches
5. **Higher investment**: More commitment to full transformation, not just pilots

**Workflow Redesign Process:**

1. Decompose workflows into discrete tasks
2. Analyze each task for automation potential and value
3. Determine optimal human-AI collaboration model
4. Re-architect decision points and task ownership
5. Implement with tight business system integration
6. Measure and optimize continuously

**Observed Impact of Redesign:**

- High performers nearly 3x more likely to redesign workflows
- Organizations redesigning report 10-25% EBITDA gains
- Faster time-to-value than adding AI to existing processes
- More sustainable competitive advantage

### Organizational Transformation Requirements
